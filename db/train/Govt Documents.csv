"The department serves as the central hub for providing training to government functionaries, with its Training Wing developing and implementing training policies. Throughout the year, various training activities are carried out, including in-service training for AIS/CSS/CSSS officers, mid-career training for IAS officers, domestic funding of foreign training, postgraduate programs, state category training, trainer development programs, intensive training programs, induction training programs, comprehensive online modules, augmentation of training institution capacity, e-governance initiatives, integrated government online training programs, and the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) - Mission Karmayogi.
Two key training institutions, Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) in Mussourie, Uttarakhand, and the Institute of Secretariat Training and Management (ISTM) in New Delhi, play crucial roles in human resource development. These institutes provide training to central government officers and All India Services (AIS) members to enhance their career progression. Additionally, the department supports the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) in conducting advanced training programs for administrators and researchers focusing on public administration.
The National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) – Mission Karmayogi, approved by the government, aims to instill behavioral and functional competencies essential for government officials at all levels. The program prioritizes equitable access to high-quality learning for officials across various cadres and geographies, democratizing professional growth. Officials can pursue competencies aligned with personal interests or professional aspirations, build expertise in those competencies, and request career progression aligned with their skills.
The Administrative Vigilance Division is responsible for formulating and implementing vigilance and anti-corruption policies within the government.

"Interim Budget 2024-2025
Speech of
Nirmala Sitharaman
Minister of Finance
February 1, 2024
Hon’ble Speaker,
I present the Interim Budget for 2024-25.
Introduction
1. The Indian economy has witnessed profound positive
transformation in the last ten years. The people of India are
looking ahead to the future with hope and optimism.
2. With the blessings of the people, when our Government
under the visionary and dynamic leadership of Hon’ble Prime
Minister Shri Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014, the country
was facing enormous challenges. With ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka
Vikas’ as its ‘mantra’, the Government overcame those
challenges in right earnest. Structural reforms were undertaken.
Pro-people programmes were formulated and implemented
promptly. Conditions were created for more opportunities for
employment and entrepreneurship. The economy got a new
vigour. The fruits of development started reaching the people at
scale. The country got a new sense of purpose and hope.
Naturally, the people blessed the Government with a bigger
mandate. 2
3. In the second term, our Government under the leadership
of Hon’ble Prime Minister doubled down on its responsibilities to
build a prosperous country with comprehensive development of
all people and all regions. Our Government strengthened its
‘mantra’ to ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, and Sabka Vishwas’. Our
development philosophy covered all elements of inclusivity,
namely,
? social inclusivity through coverage of all strata of the
society, and
? geographical inclusivity through development of all
regions of the country.
4. With the ‘whole of nation’ approach of ‘Sabka Prayas’, the
country overcame the challenge of a once-in-a-century
pandemic, took long strides towards ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’,
committed to ‘Panch Pran’, and laid solid foundations for the
‘Amrit Kaal’. As a result, our young country has high aspirations,
pride in its present, and hope and confidence for a bright future.
We expect that our Government, based on its stupendous work,
will be blessed again by the people with a resounding mandate.
Inclusive Development and Growth
5. Our humane and inclusive approach to development is a
marked and deliberate departure from the earlier approach of
‘provisioning up-to-village level’. Development programmes, in
the last ten years, have targeted each and every household and
individual, through ‘housing for all’, ‘har ghar jal’, electricity for 3
all, cooking gas for all, bank accounts and financial services for
all, in record time.",Government Documents
"International Cooperation (Chapter 11)
1.10 The Department of Personnel and
Training is the nodal Department for formation
of policies for anti-corruption in Government
of India. To deal with international cooperation
on these aspec t s an International
Cooperation Cell was created in this
Department. The primary tasks of this Cell
emanate from the follow up to the ratification
of the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption (UNCAC) and the other
consequential international collaborative
efforts, on global platforms. This Cell acts in
conjunction with specialized agencies like the
Central Bureau of Investigation, the
Enforcement Directorate and the other line
Ministries entrusted with the specific ancillary
tasks within their respective administrative
domain, viz. corporate governance,
extradition matters, prevention of money
laundering, mutual legal assistance treaties
etc.
its employees in matters of common concern.
The objective is to increase the efficiency of
public services along with the well-being of the
employees. The three tiers are:
Central Bureau of Investigation (Chapter 12)
1.11 Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
was set up by the Government of India by a
Resolution dated April 1, 1963, to not only
investigate cases of bribery and corruption
but also the cases of violation of central fiscal
laws, major frauds relating to Government of
India Departments, Public Joint Stock
Companies, passport frauds and serious
crimes committed by organized gangs and
professional criminals. CBI was further
strengthened by the addition of Economic
Offences Wing by the Government of India by
Resolution dated February 2, 1964.
Joint Consultative Machinery (Chapter 13)
1.12 The Government provides for a Joint
Consultative Machinery for joint consultation
at three levels between the Central
Government and its employees for
promoting harmonious relations and
securing the optimum level of co-operation
between the Central Government and
National Council – at the apex level,
functioning under the Department of
Personnel and Training.
Department Councils – functioning at the
level of the Ministries / Departments.
Office Counc i l s – func tioning at
offices/organisations under various
Ministries / Departments.
The Scheme has proved to be an effective
forum for amicable settlement of grievances
of the Central Government employees
relating to their service matters etc.
Administrative Tribunal (Chapter 14)
1.13 In order to provide speedy and
inexpensive justice delivery system to the
e m p l o y e e s wh o f e e l a g g ri e v e d b y
Government decisions, the Government set
up the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)
in 1985, which now deals with all cases
relating to service matters. The CAT has 19
regular benches, 17 of which operate at the
Principal seats of High Courts and the
remaining two are at Jaipur and Lucknow.
Staff Welfare (Chapter 15)
1.14 The Central Government being the
largest single employer in the country
discharges its responsibility for looking after
the welfare of employees through various
welfare measures. The Department also
extends support to various staff welfare
measures. The DoPT is the nodal
Department for registered societies set up for
the welfare of the Government employees
and their families. In addition, the Department
lays down policies for Departmental

Canteens and supports the Resident Welfare
Associations.
Right to Information (Chapter 16)
1.15 The Department has brought out a
comprehensive law to ensure the right to
information to the citizens of India in almost
entire matters of governance at all levels from
the Central Government to the local selfgovernment. The Law (RTI Act, 2005) has
provided a mechanism where the Central
Information Commission, being the apex
body at the Centre, facilitates its citizenry in
accessing information in a time-bound,
hassle-free and affordable manner.
Progressive Use of Hindi (Chapter 18)
1.17 The Department is fully committed to
promoting the use of Hindi as the official
language, in official matters and motivate
compliance of the provisions of the Official
Language Act, 1963, and the rules framed
thereunder. The Department also ensures
that the spirit of various orders and guidelines
issued by the Department of Official
Language is appropriately enforced for
implementation of the official language policy
of the Union. The Department has an Official
Language Division which monitors the
implementation of the Official Language
policy in the Department.
Grievance Redressal Mechanism &
Citizens' Charter (Chapter 17)
1.16 The Department has identified some
of the core services being offered by its
various divisions and their standards for the
purpose in its first Citizen Charter. This has
been undertaken by a Task Force in
consultation with the Stakeholders. While
identifying the services, the focus has been
on measurable and verifiable services and
their standards. The charter contains a
Grievance Redress Mechanism related to the
services mentioned in the Citizens'/Clients'
Charter. The Charter also provides links for
other grievances which are not related to the
Citizens'/Clients' Charter. Timelines have
been prescribed for final disposal of the
complaint arising out of the Citizens'/Client's
Charter.
Financial Management (Chapter 19)
1.18 For carrying out the work allocated to
the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances
and Pensions, an allocation of Rs. 112.37
crore was made in the Central Sector Scheme
Outlay for the year 2020-21 against the total
allocation of Rs. 1780.00 crore at the Revised
Estimate 2020-21 stage. The corresponding
figures for RE 2021-22 are Rs. 149.00 crore
as Central Sector Scheme Outlay against a
total allocation of Rs. 1950.00 crore (RE 2021-
22). The requirements and priorities of its
attached and subordinate offices were kept in
view while making budgetary allocation to
them by this Department. No PAC/ C&AG
Para is pending in the Ministry.",Government Documents
"The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions is the nodal Ministry responsible for
personnel matters, especially in respect of issues concerning recruitment, training, career
development, staff welfare, and the post-retirement dispensation. The Ministry also works towards
the promotion of responsive, people-oriented, and modern administration.
Various wings of DoP&Tare as under:
The Ministry comprises three Departments:
(i) Department of Personnel and Training (DoP&T)
(ii) Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG)
(iii) Department of Pensions and Pensioners' Welfare (DPPW)

"The Common Services Centers Scheme: Background
1.1 The Government of India has formulated the National E-Governance
Plan with the vision of providing all government services in an
integrated manner at the doorstep of the citizen, at an affordable cost.
The NeGP initiatives consist of 26 Central, State and Integrated
Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) along with 8 other support
components for rapid introduction of e-governance in the country. The
NeGP envisions a three pillar model for delivery of “web-enabled
Anytime, Anywhere access” to information and services in rural India.
These are:
a) Connectivity: State Wide Area Networks (SWANs)/NICNET
b) National Data Bank/ State Data Centres (SDCs)
c) Common Services Centers (CSCs)
1.2 The CSC Scheme, as approved by the Government of India, envisions
CSCs as the front-end delivery points for Government, private and
social sector services to rural citizens of India, in an integrated manner.
The objective is to develop a platform that can enable Government,
private and social sector organizations to align their social and
commercial goals for the benefit of the rural population in the remotest
corners of the country through a combination of IT-based as well as
non-IT-based services.
1.3 Thus, the CSCs cannot be seen as mere service delivery points in rural
India. The CSC is positioned as a Change Agent - that would promote
rural entrepreneurship, build rural capacities and livelihoods, enable
community participation and collective action for social change -
through a bottom-up model with focus on the rural citizen.
1.4 Undertaking such a mammoth task calls for active participation and
close interaction amongst various stakeholders such as State
Governments, local bodies, opinion makers and agencies/ institutions
involved or having interest, commercial or otherwise, in rural areas/
markets. Under the CSC Scheme, a Public Private Partnership (PPP)
model has been proposed for undertaking this challenging task and
addressing the related issues in the most effective way.
1
2. The Implementation Framework
2.1 The CSC Scheme has a 3-tier implementation framework:
a) At the first (CSC) level would be the local Village Level
Entrepreneur (VLE- loosely analogous to a franchisee), to service
the rural consumer in a cluster of 5-6 villages.
b) At the second/middle level would be an entity termed the Service
Centre Agency (SCA – loosely analogous to a franchiser) to
operate, manage and build the VLE network and business. An SCA
would be identified for one or more districts (one district would
cover 100-200 CSCs).
c) At the third level would be the agency designated by the State- the
State Designated Agency (SDA) - to facilitate implementation of
the Scheme within the State and to provide requisite policy, content
and other support to the SCAs.
3. Other Agencies
3.1 The National Level Service Agency (NLSA): There are significant
challenges in exploiting opportunities to achieve economies of scale in
the identification, customization and implementation of the physical
and digital infrastructure required for the project. Further, many of the
potential citizen-centric services would lend themselves to aggregation
at the national level. To enable the State-specific implementation plans
to benefit from such economies of scale, aggregation of best practices,
content providers, etc., the DIT would be appointing a National Level
Service Agency (NLSA).
3.2 The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV): In addition to the NLSA, an SPV
has been proposed for the day-to-day monitoring of the CSC Scheme,
in terms of channeling Government support, content aggregation, etc.
While the SPV is proposed to be set up during the initial
implementation phase of the Scheme, it is essentially an entity created
to be an integral part of the CSC ",Government Documents
"Role of various Agencies
4.1 Service Centre Agency (SCA): The Prime Driver
4.1.1. The SCA would be the prime driver of the whole CSC eco-system. The
SCA would be supported by the NLSA and the respective State
Designated Agency (SDA) to implement the CSC Scheme in their
specified areas of operations. This could include activities such as
identifying the required applications and services, harnessing the State
Wide Area Network, identifying, selecting and training the VLE,
establishing the CSC (either directly or through the VLE), supplying,
aggregating and updating content.
4.1.2. The success or failure of the CSC Scheme hinges to a large extent on
the business and financial capabilities of the SCA, as the Scheme is not
about rolling out IT hardware in rural areas, but building 100,000 rural
businesses in hitherto untapped and unchartered areas of the country,
besides promoting rural entrepreneurship and involving community
participation.
4.1.3. The existing kiosks models are on a small scale. The CSC Scheme at
the scale it is proposed to be implemented may pose a variety of
complex new issues in terms of financing, channel management,
technology, integration with local community, etc. that may put the
CSC network at risk, if not supported by a committed and financially
strong SCA with adequate experience of working with rural
communities. Consequently, the selection of the right SCA assumes
significant importance for the State. It is therefore recommended that
the selection of the SCAs should be undertaken with adequate care and
caution, with appropriate support from the NLSA and DIT.
4.2 The Village Level Entrepreneur
4.2.1. The VLE is the key to the success of the CSC operations. While
content and services are important, it is the VLE’s entrepreneurial
ability that would ensure CSC sustainability. A good VLE is expected
to have some financial strength, entrepreneurial ability, strong social
commitment as well as respect within the community. The quality of
service at the CSCs would depend a great deal on the quality of VLEs.
3
Selection and proper training of the VLE, therefore would play a vital
role in making the CSC Scheme a success.
4.3 The State Government
4.3.1. The major roles envisaged for the State Government are as follows:
a) Setting up of a High Level Committee for overseeing the
implementation of the CSC Scheme
b) The HLC would oversee the functioning of the SDA with
reference to the CSC Scheme, including the process of selection of the
SCAs. The functions of the HLC could also be performed by the Apex
Committee proposed vide the Capacity Building guidelines issued by
the DIT vide letter no 1(2)/05-EGD dated 22nd March 2005. The
NLSA should be associated with the HLC/ Apex Committee on issues
relating to the CSC Scheme.
c) Driver for policy, regulatory and other relevant changes
d) Providing Financial Support
e) Designating an Agency of the Government to receive the financial
support from the State government & the Government of India
f) Service provider for e-Government services
g) Infrastructure and other support to the State Designated Agency
(SDA)/SCA
h) Take an appropriate decision on the mode and degree of integration
with the CSC Scheme of the existing physical, digital and
institutional infrastructure of various Government Agencies/
Departments in the State, such as Schools, Gram Panchayats,
Public Health Centres (PHC), Community Information Centres
(CICs) etc and Post Offices (in consultation with GOI).
i) Decide on the extent and modalities of integration with the CSC
Scheme of existing Government schemes particularly development
programmes in areas like Education, Health, Agriculture,
Employment, etc. ",Government Documents

"The Common Services Centers Scheme: Background
1.1 The Government of India has formulated the National E-Governance
Plan with the vision of providing all government services in an
integrated manner at the doorstep of the citizen, at an affordable cost.
The NeGP initiatives consist of 26 Central, State and Integrated
Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) along with 8 other support
components for rapid introduction of e-governance in the country. The
NeGP envisions a three pillar model for delivery of “web-enabled
Anytime, Anywhere access” to information and services in rural India.
These are:
a) Connectivity: State Wide Area Networks (SWANs)/NICNET
b) National Data Bank/ State Data Centres (SDCs)
c) Common Services Centers (CSCs)
1.2 The CSC Scheme, as approved by the Government of India, envisions
CSCs as the front-end delivery points for Government, private and
social sector services to rural citizens of India, in an integrated manner.
The objective is to develop a platform that can enable Government,
private and social sector organizations to align their social and
commercial goals for the benefit of the rural population in the remotest
corners of the country through a combination of IT-based as well as
non-IT-based services.
1.3 Thus, the CSCs cannot be seen as mere service delivery points in rural
India. The CSC is positioned as a Change Agent - that would promote
rural entrepreneurship, build rural capacities and livelihoods, enable
community participation and collective action for social change -
through a bottom-up model with focus on the rural citizen.
1.4 Undertaking such a mammoth task calls for active participation and
close interaction amongst various stakeholders such as State
Governments, local bodies, opinion makers and agencies/ institutions
involved or having interest, commercial or otherwise, in rural areas/
markets. Under the CSC Scheme, a Public Private Partnership (PPP)
model has been proposed for undertaking this challenging task and
addressing the related issues in the most effective way.

2. The Implementation Framework
2.1 The CSC Scheme has a 3-tier implementation framework:
a) At the first (CSC) level would be the local Village Level
Entrepreneur (VLE- loosely analogous to a franchisee), to service
the rural consumer in a cluster of 5-6 villages.
b) At the second/middle level would be an entity termed the Service
Centre Agency (SCA – loosely analogous to a franchiser) to
operate, manage and build the VLE network and business. An SCA
would be identified for one or more districts (one district would
cover 100-200 CSCs).
c) At the third level would be the agency designated by the State- the
State Designated Agency (SDA) - to facilitate implementation of
the Scheme within the State and to provide requisite policy, content
and other support to the SCAs.
3. Other Agencies
3.1 The National Level Service Agency (NLSA): There are significant
challenges in exploiting opportunities to achieve economies of scale in
the identification, customization and implementation of the physical
and digital infrastructure required for the project. Further, many of the
potential citizen-centric services would lend themselves to aggregation
at the national level. To enable the State-specific implementation plans
to benefit from such economies of scale, aggregation of best practices,
content providers, etc., the DIT would be appointing a National Level
Service Agency (NLSA).
3.2 The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV): In addition to the NLSA, an SPV
has been proposed for the day-to-day monitoring of the CSC Scheme,
in terms of channeling Government support, content aggregation, etc.
While the SPV is proposed to be set up during the initial
implementation phase of the Scheme, it is essentially an entity created
to be an integral part of the CSC",Government Documents
"1. Preamble
Digital India program envisages to transform India into digital empowered society and knowledge
economy. The Digital India vision provides the intensified impetus for further momentum and progress
for e-Governance and would promote inclusive growth that covers electronic services, products,
devices, manufacturing and job opportunities. Governance and Services on demand is an important
component in Digital India program and includes programs to offer seamlessly integrated, real time
online services to citizens with platforms enabled for electronic & cashless financial transactions.
Departments are being encouraged and supported to fully leverage the Common and Support ICT
Infrastructure established by Government of India.
Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has been tasked with evolving/ laying
down standards and policy guidelines, provide technical and handholding support, undertake capacity
building, R&D, etc. and further evolve the Digital India vision.
The aim is that all departments are in a position to collect and make payments in an electronic mode.
MeitY envisions that multiple payment channels should be available to enable electronic transactions,
provide ease of access, and competitive transaction charges for users.
2. Background
Ministry of Electronic and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India envisages webenabled/mobile enabled anytime, anywhere access to information and services across the country,
especially in rural and remote parts of India. MeitY further envisages common e-Governance
infrastructure that will offer end-to-end transactional experience for a citizen, businesses as well as
internal government functions, which includes accessing various services through internet with payment
gateway interface for online payments.
Since 2008-09, Central Government Departments are already using Public Finance Management
Systems (PFMS) for plan/ non-plan schemes. With 139 Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and more
than 800 Central Sector Schemes (CS), along with State Plans and Additional Central Assistance
(ACA), the PFMS is managing funds in excess of Rs.3,00,000 crore annually.1 In 2013, for the
payments of Government schemes directly to beneficiary, DBT module was also included in PFMS. In

Guidelines for Adoption of Electronic Payments and Receipts (EPR)
Version: 01 Page 7 of 39
2015, for the payments and accounting, a dedicated module was launched and is being rolled out to pay
and accounts offices of Central Ministries.
The Apex Committee on Digital India Programme has recommended a targeted approach to implement
digital payments for citizens across all the e-Services of Government Ministries and Departments as per
following timelines.
• Departments to provide for electronic payment system for all payments and receipts by 31st March,
2016
• At least 90 percent of all the payments and receipts online by 31st December 2016.
Against this backdrop, MeitY has prepared this framework, intended for State Governments, Govt. of
India Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings and Municipalities for expeditiously
implementing appropriate mechanism to enable electronic payments and receipts.
3. Objectives
The objective of this framework is to provide guidelines for Departments to:
i.Assess various services involving payments and receipts by types of services and level of electronic
payment enablement
ii.Provide actionable instructions for universal adoption of electronic payment modes for each type of
service through various payment channels
iii.Provide guidelines on engagement with various payment service providers
4. Policy Statement
Jan Dhan Yojana, the Aadhaar initiative of UIDAI and Mobile number (JAM), this Trinity of reforms is
one of the biggest pieces of reform ever attempted in India for direct subsidy transfer to poor citizens of
India. With financial inclusion as one of the key priorities of Government, using JAM, it is necessary
for Government Departments to adopt modes of electronic payments & receipts for its internal and
external transactions.
There exist a large number of options for enabling various payment channels and electronic modes for
payments/receipts. This framework is formulated with the aim of enabling 100 percent electronic
payment for all the external or internal transactions of the Departments.
The framework provides the guidelines for facilitating the Departments to expeditiously enable
electronic payments and receipts leveraging all the payment channels.",Government Documents
