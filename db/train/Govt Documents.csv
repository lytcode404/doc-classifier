"The department serves as the central hub for providing training to government functionaries, with its Training Wing developing and implementing training policies. Throughout the year, various training activities are carried out, including in-service training for AIS/CSS/CSSS officers, mid-career training for IAS officers, domestic funding of foreign training, postgraduate programs, state category training, trainer development programs, intensive training programs, induction training programs, comprehensive online modules, augmentation of training institution capacity, e-governance initiatives, integrated government online training programs, and the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) - Mission Karmayogi.
Two key training institutions, Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) in Mussourie, Uttarakhand, and the Institute of Secretariat Training and Management (ISTM) in New Delhi, play crucial roles in human resource development. These institutes provide training to central government officers and All India Services (AIS) members to enhance their career progression. Additionally, the department supports the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) in conducting advanced training programs for administrators and researchers focusing on public administration.
The National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) ñ Mission Karmayogi, approved by the government, aims to instill behavioral and functional competencies essential for government officials at all levels. The program prioritizes equitable access to high-quality learning for officials across various cadres and geographies, democratizing professional growth. Officials can pursue competencies aligned with personal interests or professional aspirations, build expertise in those competencies, and request career progression aligned with their skills.

"Interim Budget 2024-2025
Speech of
Nirmala Sitharaman
Minister of Finance
February 1, 2024
Honíble Speaker,
I present the Interim Budget for 2024-25.
Introduction
1. The Indian economy has witnessed profound positive
transformation in the last ten years. The people of India are
looking ahead to the future with hope and optimism.
2. With the blessings of the people, when our Government
under the visionary and dynamic leadership of Honíble Prime
Minister Shri Narendra Modi assumed office in 2014, the country
was facing enormous challenges. With ëSabka Saath, Sabka
Vikasí as its ëmantraí, the Government overcame those
challenges in right earnest. Structural reforms were undertaken.
Pro-people programmes were formulated and implemented
promptly. Conditions were created for more opportunities for
employment and entrepreneurship. The economy got a new
vigour. The fruits of development started reaching the people at
scale. The country got a new sense of purpose and hope.
Naturally, the people blessed the Government with a bigger
mandate. 2
3. In the second term, our Government under the leadership
of Honíble Prime Minister doubled down on its responsibilities to
build a prosperous country with comprehensive development of
all people and all regions. Our Government strengthened its
ëmantraí to ëSabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, and Sabka Vishwasí. Our
development philosophy covered all elements of inclusivity,
namely,
? social inclusivity through coverage of all strata of the
society, and
? geographical inclusivity through development of all
regions of the country.
4. With the ëwhole of nationí approach of ëSabka Prayasí, the
country overcame the challenge of a once-in-a-century
pandemic, took long strides towards ëAtmanirbhar Bharatí,
committed to ëPanch Praní, and laid solid foundations for the
ëAmrit Kaalí. As a result, our young country has high aspirations,
pride in its present, and hope and confidence for a bright future.
We expect that our Government, based on its stupendous work,
will be blessed again by the people with a resounding mandate.
Inclusive Development and Growth
5. Our humane and inclusive approach to development is a
marked and deliberate departure from the earlier approach of
ëprovisioning up-to-village levelí. Development programmes, in
the last ten years, have targeted each and every household and
individual, through ëhousing for allí, ëhar ghar jalí, electricity for 3
all, cooking gas for all, bank accounts and financial services for
all, in record time.",Government Documents
"International Cooperation (Chapter 11)
1.10 The Department of Personnel and
Training is the nodal Department for formation
of policies for anti-corruption in Government
of India. To deal with international cooperation
on these aspec t s an International
Cooperation Cell was created in this
Department. The primary tasks of this Cell
emanate from the follow up to the ratification
of the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption (UNCAC) and the other
consequential international collaborative
efforts, on global platforms. This Cell acts in
conjunction with specialized agencies like the
Central Bureau of Investigation, the
Enforcement Directorate and the other line
Ministries entrusted with the specific ancillary
tasks within their respective administrative
domain, viz. corporate governance,
extradition matters, prevention of money
laundering, mutual legal assistance treaties
etc.
its employees in matters of common concern.
The objective is to increase the efficiency of
public services along with the well-being of the
employees. The three tiers are:
Central Bureau of Investigation (Chapter 12)
1.11 Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
was set up by the Government of India by a
Resolution dated April 1, 1963, to not only
investigate cases of bribery and corruption
but also the cases of violation of central fiscal
laws, major frauds relating to Government of
India Departments, Public Joint Stock
Companies, passport frauds and serious
crimes committed by organized gangs and
professional criminals. CBI was further
strengthened by the addition of Economic
Offences Wing by the Government of India by
Resolution dated February 2, 1964.
Joint Consultative Machinery (Chapter 13)
1.12 The Government provides for a Joint
Consultative Machinery for joint consultation
at three levels between the Central
Government and its employees for
promoting harmonious relations and
securing the optimum level of co-operation
between the Central Government and
National Council ñ at the apex level,
functioning under the Department of
Personnel and Training.
Department Councils ñ functioning at the
level of the Ministries / Departments.
Office Counc i l s ñ func tioning at
offices/organisations under various
Ministries / Departments.
The Scheme has proved to be an effective
forum for amicable settlement of grievances
of the Central Government employees
relating to their service matters etc.
Administrative Tribunal (Chapter 14)
1.13 In order to provide speedy and
inexpensive justice delivery system to the
e m p l o y e e s wh o f e e l a g g ri e v e d b y
Government decisions, the Government set
up the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)
in 1985, which now deals with all cases
relating to service matters. The CAT has 19
regular benches, 17 of which operate at the
Principal seats of High Courts and the
remaining two are at Jaipur and Lucknow.
Staff Welfare (Chapter 15)
1.14 The Central Government being the
largest single employer in the country
discharges its responsibility for looking after
the welfare of employees through various
welfare measures. The Department also
extends support to various staff welfare
measures. The DoPT is the nodal
Department for registered societies set up for
the welfare of the Government employees
and their families. In addition, the Department
lays down policies for Departmental

Canteens and supports the Resident Welfare
Associations.
Right to Information (Chapter 16)
1.15 The Department has brought out a
comprehensive law to ensure the right to
information to the citizens of India in almost
entire matters of governance at all levels from
the Central Government to the local selfgovernment. The Law (RTI Act, 2005) has
provided a mechanism where the Central
Information Commission, being the apex
body at the Centre, facilitates its citizenry in
accessing information in a time-bound,
hassle-free and affordable manner.
Progressive Use of Hindi (Chapter 18)
1.17 The Department is fully committed to
promoting the use of Hindi as the official
language, in official matters and motivate
compliance of the provisions of the Official
Language Act, 1963, and the rules framed
thereunder. The Department also ensures
that the spirit of various orders and guidelines
issued by the Department of Official
Language is appropriately enforced for
implementation of the official language policy
of the Union. The Department has an Official
Language Division which monitors the
implementation of the Official Language
policy in the Department.
Grievance Redressal Mechanism &
Citizens' Charter (Chapter 17)
1.16 The Department has identified some
of the core services being offered by its
various divisions and their standards for the
purpose in its first Citizen Charter. This has
been undertaken by a Task Force in
consultation with the Stakeholders. While
identifying the services, the focus has been
on measurable and verifiable services and
their standards. The charter contains a
Grievance Redress Mechanism related to the
services mentioned in the Citizens'/Clients'
Charter. The Charter also provides links for
other grievances which are not related to the
Citizens'/Clients' Charter. Timelines have
been prescribed for final disposal of the
complaint arising out of the Citizens'/Client's
Charter.
Financial Management (Chapter 19)
1.18 For carrying out the work allocated to
the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances
and Pensions, an allocation of Rs. 112.37
crore was made in the Central Sector Scheme
Outlay for the year 2020-21 against the total
allocation of Rs. 1780.00 crore at the Revised
Estimate 2020-21 stage. The corresponding
figures for RE 2021-22 are Rs. 149.00 crore
as Central Sector Scheme Outlay against a
total allocation of Rs. 1950.00 crore (RE 2021-
22). The requirements and priorities of its
attached and subordinate offices were kept in
view while making budgetary allocation to
them by this Department. No PAC/ C&AG
Para is pending in the Ministry.",Government Documents
"The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions is the nodal Ministry responsible for
personnel matters, especially in respect of issues concerning recruitment, training, career
development, staff welfare, and the post-retirement dispensation. The Ministry also works towards
the promotion of responsive, people-oriented, and modern administration.
Various wings of DoP&Tare as under:
The Ministry comprises three Departments:
(i) Department of Personnel and Training (DoP&T)
(ii) Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG)

"The Common Services Centers Scheme: Background
1.1 The Government of India has formulated the National E-Governance
Plan with the vision of providing all government services in an
integrated manner at the doorstep of the citizen, at an affordable cost.
The NeGP initiatives consist of 26 Central, State and Integrated
Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) along with 8 other support
components for rapid introduction of e-governance in the country. The
NeGP envisions a three pillar model for delivery of ìweb-enabled
Anytime, Anywhere accessî to information and services in rural India.
These are:
a) Connectivity: State Wide Area Networks (SWANs)/NICNET
b) National Data Bank/ State Data Centres (SDCs)
c) Common Services Centers (CSCs)
1.2 The CSC Scheme, as approved by the Government of India, envisions
CSCs as the front-end delivery points for Government, private and
social sector services to rural citizens of India, in an integrated manner.
The objective is to develop a platform that can enable Government,
private and social sector organizations to align their social and
commercial goals for the benefit of the rural population in the remotest
corners of the country through a combination of IT-based as well as
non-IT-based services.
1.3 Thus, the CSCs cannot be seen as mere service delivery points in rural
India. The CSC is positioned as a Change Agent - that would promote
rural entrepreneurship, build rural capacities and livelihoods, enable
community participation and collective action for social change -
through a bottom-up model with focus on the rural citizen.
1.4 Undertaking such a mammoth task calls for active participation and
close interaction amongst various stakeholders such as State
Governments, local bodies, opinion makers and agencies/ institutions
involved or having interest, commercial or otherwise, in rural areas/
markets. Under the CSC Scheme, a Public Private Partnership (PPP)
model has been proposed for undertaking this challenging task and
addressing the related issues in the most effective way.
1
2. The Implementation Framework
2.1 The CSC Scheme has a 3-tier implementation framework:
a) At the first (CSC) level would be the local Village Level
Entrepreneur (VLE- loosely analogous to a franchisee), to service
the rural consumer in a cluster of 5-6 villages.
b) At the second/middle level would be an entity termed the Service
Centre Agency (SCA ñ loosely analogous to a franchiser) to
operate, manage and build the VLE network and business. An SCA
would be identified for one or more districts (one district would
cover 100-200 CSCs).
c) At the third level would be the agency designated by the State- the
State Designated Agency (SDA) - to facilitate implementation of
the Scheme within the State and to provide requisite policy, content
and other support to the SCAs.
3. Other Agencies
3.1 The National Level Service Agency (NLSA): There are significant
challenges in exploiting opportunities to achieve economies of scale in
the identification, customization and implementation of the physical
and digital infrastructure required for the project. Further, many of the
potential citizen-centric services would lend themselves to aggregation
at the national level. To enable the State-specific implementation plans
to benefit from such economies of scale, aggregation of best practices,
content providers, etc., the DIT would be appointing a National Level
Service Agency (NLSA).
3.2 The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV): In addition to the NLSA, an SPV
has been proposed for the day-to-day monitoring of the CSC Scheme,
in terms of channeling Government support, content aggregation, etc.
While the SPV is proposed to be set up during the initial
implementation phase of the Scheme, it is essentially an entity created
to be an integral part of the CSC ",Government Documents
"Role of various Agencies
4.1 Service Centre Agency (SCA): The Prime Driver
4.1.1. The SCA would be the prime driver of the whole CSC eco-system. The
SCA would be supported by the NLSA and the respective State
Designated Agency (SDA) to implement the CSC Scheme in their
specified areas of operations. This could include activities such as
identifying the required applications and services, harnessing the State
Wide Area Network, identifying, selecting and training the VLE,
establishing the CSC (either directly or through the VLE), supplying,
aggregating and updating content.
4.1.2. The success or failure of the CSC Scheme hinges to a large extent on
the business and financial capabilities of the SCA, as the Scheme is not
about rolling out IT hardware in rural areas, but building 100,000 rural
businesses in hitherto untapped and unchartered areas of the country,
besides promoting rural entrepreneurship and involving community
participation.
4.1.3. The existing kiosks models are on a small scale. The CSC Scheme at
the scale it is proposed to be implemented may pose a variety of
complex new issues in terms of financing, channel management,
technology, integration with local community, etc. that may put the
CSC network at risk, if not supported by a committed and financially
strong SCA with adequate experience of working with rural
communities. Consequently, the selection of the right SCA assumes
significant importance for the State. It is therefore recommended that
the selection of the SCAs should be undertaken with adequate care and
caution, with appropriate support from the NLSA and DIT.
4.2 The Village Level Entrepreneur
4.2.1. The VLE is the key to the success of the CSC operations. While
content and services are important, it is the VLEís entrepreneurial
ability that would ensure CSC sustainability. A good VLE is expected
to have some financial strength, entrepreneurial ability, strong social
commitment as well as respect within the community. The quality of
service at the CSCs would depend a great deal on the quality of VLEs.
3
Selection and proper training of the VLE, therefore would play a vital
role in making the CSC Scheme a success.
4.3 The State Government
4.3.1. The major roles envisaged for the State Government are as follows:
a) Setting up of a High Level Committee for overseeing the
implementation of the CSC Scheme
b) The HLC would oversee the functioning of the SDA with
reference to the CSC Scheme, including the process of selection of the
SCAs. The functions of the HLC could also be performed by the Apex
Committee proposed vide the Capacity Building guidelines issued by
the DIT vide letter no 1(2)/05-EGD dated 22nd March 2005. The
NLSA should be associated with the HLC/ Apex Committee on issues
relating to the CSC Scheme.
c) Driver for policy, regulatory and other relevant changes
d) Providing Financial Support
e) Designating an Agency of the Government to receive the financial
support from the State government & the Government of India
f) Service provider for e-Government services
g) Infrastructure and other support to the State Designated Agency
(SDA)/SCA
h) Take an appropriate decision on the mode and degree of integration
with the CSC Scheme of the existing physical, digital and
institutional infrastructure of various Government Agencies/
Departments in the State, such as Schools, Gram Panchayats,
Public Health Centres (PHC), Community Information Centres
(CICs) etc and Post Offices (in consultation with GOI).
i) Decide on the extent and modalities of integration with the CSC
Scheme of existing Government schemes particularly development
programmes in areas like Education, Health, Agriculture,
Employment, etc. ",Government Documents

"The Common Services Centers Scheme: Background
1.1 The Government of India has formulated the National E-Governance
Plan with the vision of providing all government services in an
integrated manner at the doorstep of the citizen, at an affordable cost.
The NeGP initiatives consist of 26 Central, State and Integrated
Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) along with 8 other support
components for rapid introduction of e-governance in the country. The
NeGP envisions a three pillar model for delivery of ìweb-enabled
Anytime, Anywhere accessî to information and services in rural India.
These are:
a) Connectivity: State Wide Area Networks (SWANs)/NICNET
b) National Data Bank/ State Data Centres (SDCs)
c) Common Services Centers (CSCs)
1.2 The CSC Scheme, as approved by the Government of India, envisions
CSCs as the front-end delivery points for Government, private and
social sector services to rural citizens of India, in an integrated manner.
The objective is to develop a platform that can enable Government,
private and social sector organizations to align their social and
commercial goals for the benefit of the rural population in the remotest
corners of the country through a combination of IT-based as well as
non-IT-based services.
1.3 Thus, the CSCs cannot be seen as mere service delivery points in rural
India. The CSC is positioned as a Change Agent - that would promote
rural entrepreneurship, build rural capacities and livelihoods, enable
community participation and collective action for social change -
through a bottom-up model with focus on the rural citizen.
1.4 Undertaking such a mammoth task calls for active participation and
close interaction amongst various stakeholders such as State
Governments, local bodies, opinion makers and agencies/ institutions
involved or having interest, commercial or otherwise, in rural areas/
markets. Under the CSC Scheme, a Public Private Partnership (PPP)
model has been proposed for undertaking this challenging task and
addressing the related issues in the most effective way.
1
2. The Implementation Framework
2.1 The CSC Scheme has a 3-tier implementation framework:
a) At the first (CSC) level would be the local Village Level
Entrepreneur (VLE- loosely analogous to a franchisee), to service
the rural consumer in a cluster of 5-6 villages.
b) At the second/middle level would be an entity termed the Service
Centre Agency (SCA ñ loosely analogous to a franchiser) to
operate, manage and build the VLE network and business. An SCA
would be identified for one or more districts (one district would
cover 100-200 CSCs).
c) At the third level would be the agency designated by the State- the
State Designated Agency (SDA) - to facilitate implementation of
the Scheme within the State and to provide requisite policy, content
and other support to the SCAs.
3. Other Agencies
3.1 The National Level Service Agency (NLSA): There are significant
challenges in exploiting opportunities to achieve economies of scale in
the identification, customization and implementation of the physical
and digital infrastructure required for the project. Further, many of the
potential citizen-centric services would lend themselves to aggregation
at the national level. To enable the State-specific implementation plans
to benefit from such economies of scale, aggregation of best practices,
content providers, etc., the DIT would be appointing a National Level
Service Agency (NLSA).
3.2 The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV): In addition to the NLSA, an SPV
has been proposed for the day-to-day monitoring of the CSC Scheme,
in terms of channeling Government support, content aggregation, etc.
While the SPV is proposed to be set up during the initial
implementation phase of the Scheme, it is essentially an entity created
to be an integral part of the CSC",Government Documents
"1. Preamble
Digital India program envisages to transform India into digital empowered society and knowledge
economy. The Digital India vision provides the intensified impetus for further momentum and progress
for e-Governance and would promote inclusive growth that covers electronic services, products,
devices, manufacturing and job opportunities. Governance and Services on demand is an important
component in Digital India program and includes programs to offer seamlessly integrated, real time
online services to citizens with platforms enabled for electronic & cashless financial transactions.
Departments are being encouraged and supported to fully leverage the Common and Support ICT
Infrastructure established by Government of India.
Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has been tasked with evolving/ laying
down standards and policy guidelines, provide technical and handholding support, undertake capacity
building, R&D, etc. and further evolve the Digital India vision.
The aim is that all departments are in a position to collect and make payments in an electronic mode.
MeitY envisions that multiple payment channels should be available to enable electronic transactions,
provide ease of access, and competitive transaction charges for users.
2. Background
Ministry of Electronic and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India envisages webenabled/mobile enabled anytime, anywhere access to information and services across the country,
especially in rural and remote parts of India. MeitY further envisages common e-Governance
infrastructure that will offer end-to-end transactional experience for a citizen, businesses as well as
internal government functions, which includes accessing various services through internet with payment
gateway interface for online payments.
Since 2008-09, Central Government Departments are already using Public Finance Management
Systems (PFMS) for plan/ non-plan schemes. With 139 Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and more
than 800 Central Sector Schemes (CS), along with State Plans and Additional Central Assistance
(ACA), the PFMS is managing funds in excess of Rs.3,00,000 crore annually.1 In 2013, for the
payments of Government schemes directly to beneficiary, DBT module was also included in PFMS. In

Guidelines for Adoption of Electronic Payments and Receipts (EPR)
Version: 01 Page 7 of 39
2015, for the payments and accounting, a dedicated module was launched and is being rolled out to pay
and accounts offices of Central Ministries.
The Apex Committee on Digital India Programme has recommended a targeted approach to implement
digital payments for citizens across all the e-Services of Government Ministries and Departments as per
following timelines.
ï Departments to provide for electronic payment system for all payments and receipts by 31st March,
2016
ï At least 90 percent of all the payments and receipts online by 31st December 2016.
Against this backdrop, MeitY has prepared this framework, intended for State Governments, Govt. of
India Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings and Municipalities for expeditiously
implementing appropriate mechanism to enable electronic payments and receipts.
3. Objectives
The objective of this framework is to provide guidelines for Departments to:
i.Assess various services involving payments and receipts by types of services and level of electronic
payment enablement
ii.Provide actionable instructions for universal adoption of electronic payment modes for each type of
service through various payment channels
iii.Provide guidelines on engagement with various payment service providers
4. Policy Statement
Jan Dhan Yojana, the Aadhaar initiative of UIDAI and Mobile number (JAM), this Trinity of reforms is
one of the biggest pieces of reform ever attempted in India for direct subsidy transfer to poor citizens of
India. With financial inclusion as one of the key priorities of Government, using JAM, it is necessary
for Government Departments to adopt modes of electronic payments & receipts for its internal and
external transactions.
There exist a large number of options for enabling various payment channels and electronic modes for
payments/receipts. This framework is formulated with the aim of enabling 100 percent electronic
payment for all the external or internal transactions of the Departments.
The framework provides the guidelines for facilitating the Departments to expeditiously enable
electronic payments and receipts leveraging all the payment channels.",Government Documents

The General Managers - All Zonal Railways and Production Units
Subject: Revised Estimates 2012-13 and Budget Estimates 2013-14.
Detailed instructions for preparation of the subject estimates are enclosed. These
are to be observed scrupulously for better assessment and timely submission to the
Railway Board keeping in view the following points.
1. The tendency to project liberal requirements without any linkages with the
activities proposed to be undertaken should be avoided while framing the estimates. In
2011-12, the Railways/Units had asked more than Rs 5,000 crore additional in the RE
stage , against which only Rs 2,000 crore was provided additionally but ultimately the
Railways surrendered more than Rs 1,113 crore as per actual.
2. The constraints of resources should be kept in view. IR had closed two successive
years with deficits and a loan had to be taken at a high interest rate to cover the gap.
3. For Ordinary Working Expenses, Revised Estimates should be based on Working
Budget Grant (WBG) only. Any additional requirement over WBG would be considered
only for Staff related expenses including fresh recruitments and Fuel (traction). The
additional requirement for these two items should be separately brought out with
supporting details.
4. Revised Estimates for Demand No. 16 should be strictly based on Reassessed
Budget Grant-2 (RBG-2)
5. Earnings shortfall should be matched by corresponding savings over and above
the WBG of OWE/RBG-2 of Plan. The areas where savings are proposed to be effected
should be indicated clearly.
6. The current shortfall in earnings is more than Rs 1,700 cr. and each zonal Railways
was requested to identify savings of Rs 100 cr over WBG and RBG for OWE and Plan
expenditure separately. This is still awaited.

subsequent paras must be furnished strictly as per the schedule.
1.4 Defined contribution Pension Scheme: Zonal Railways should book expenditure on this
account under sub-head 890 of Demand No. 13, Railway Board under Demand No.1 and the
units operating Demand No.2 under this Demand. Production Units should book this
expenditure under WMS in Demand No.16. The Primary Unit to be operated for this in Demand
No.1 and 2 & 13 is ì08-Govt. Contribution towards Defined Contributory Pension Schemeî and
not the ìOther Expensesî being used by some of the Railways.
2.0 Demand No.2: Miscellaneous Expenditure (General)

dated 01.10.1992 and also letter no. 97-B-302 dated 17.10.97 with detailed reasons for variations
duly vetted by Associate Finance. The demand for additional funds may be justified with
detailed reasons. Railway Recruitment Boards should also furnish information prescribed in
Annexures M-3 and M-4 sent vide Board's letter no. 92-B-200 dated 01.10.1992. RRBs should also
furnish the miscellaneous receipts such as amount realized from candidates as examination fee,
etc.
- 3 -
2.4 Annexure 'D' to Demand 2- Reimbursement of cost of Statutory Railway Audit: The
estimates should be sent as per proforma contained in Annexure M-5 accompanied by Primary
Unit-wise details as Annexure M-2, both sent vide Board's letter no. 92-B-200 dated 01.10.1992.
2.5 Annexure 'E' to Demand 2: Estimates related to Payment to worked lines and subsidised
companies may please be sent as per proforma contained in Annexure M-6 sent vide Board's
letter no. 92-B-200 dated 1.10.92.
2.6 Staff strength of Group 'A', 'B', 'C' & 'D' for the current and next budget year may also
invariably be furnished as prescribed in Annexure M-3 sent vide Board's letter No. 92-B-200
dated 1.10.92 and 97-B-302 dated 17.10.97. The Pay scale of Group A and B should also be
indicated where applicable.
3.0 Ordinary Working Expenses
3.1 Demand-wise Gross, Credits and Net figures of the Railways in respect of Actuals 2011-
12 should exactly tally with the figures already furnished by them for the Appropriation
Accounts.
 Under Demand No. 12, Gross, Credit and Net figures of the total of Minor Heads 100 to
700 and various components of Minor Head 800 (i.e. MAR-Compensation Claims, Others,
Passengers Insurance Scheme and Demands Payable) of Actuals 2011-12 should also exactly
tally with the each corresponding figure of Abstract K and Abstract N respectively of
Appropriation Accounts.
 Similarly in respect of Demand No.13, figures of Actuals 2011-12 in respect of Minor
Heads 100 to 700 and 800 as well as sub-heads 910, 920 and 940 should also exactly tally with
the each corresponding figure of the Appropriation Accounts.
3.2 Railways should not change the Minor-head wise/Primary-unit wise details of Budget
Grant 2012-13 already forwarded to them vide this Ministryís letter No.2012-B-233 dated
25.07.12. In the previous years, few Railways were not followings these instructions.
3.3 It has been observed that some Railways send the estimates in a hurry and later on
keep modifying the same. As it is difficult to entertain changes after the processing of data
starts, it may be ensured that the estimates are final in all respects when they are sent.
3.4 If the Railways have added any new Minor/Sub head or changed the booking pattern
of expenditure from one Primary Unit to another, the same may be specifically brought to the
knowledge of Board for proper evaluation. Instead of simply forwarding the estimates,
special features and gist of variations between BG and RE and; RE and BE for the next fiscal,
under each demand should be given, as most of the Railways are not submitting reasons for
variations in time and those submitting the same give stereo-type and sketchy reasons.
3.5 The computer file (*.dmp) and two hard copies, duly authenticated by the FA&CAO
(Budget) should be sent by the due date. In any case, a summary of the estimates in Annexure
R-l and summary by primary units as per format of Annexure R-2 should be sent to reach the
Railway Board by 03.12.2012. These should be followed by the formats of detailed estimates and
other Annexures referred to in the following Paras.
3.6 The Revised Estimates 2012-13 should be based on Actuals for the first six months and
Approximates for the seventh month and the Railways should project their full savings potential
for the fiscal on the basis of saving achieved to end of October, 12.
- 4 -

3.7 The Railways should make every effort to formulate their estimates in such a manner that
various post-budgetary increases and unforeseen expenditure are met within the Budget
Grant as far as possible. Further, credits/ recoveries should be estimated with utmost care as
variation in the budgeted and actual credit recoveries has been seriously viewed by Audit.
3.8 Railways have to furnish detailed reasons for variations separately generated through the
program in respect of each of the Minor Heads, taking all Primary Units together; and by
Primary Units, for the Demand as a whole.
3.9 Credits should be projected only under the Primary Unit ëOther Expensesí and as per
the requirement of data entry program, credits should be entered in minus only.
3.10 Demand No. 13: As has already been mentioned in para 1.4 ibid, in case of zonal Railways
the provisions for the Govt. contribution towards Defined Contributory Pension Scheme are
being made only under sub-head 890 of Demand No. 13. Therefore, the provision must be
booked only under the sub-head 890-Primary Unit 08 of Demand No.13.

3.11 Expenditure in respect of Minor Head-800/Suspense/D12 should be booked only
under primary unit ëOther Expensesí.

3.12 Despite the Primary Unit-41 ëValue Added Tax (VAT) being applicable in almost all
states, some Railways have been booking/projecting negligible expenditure under this Primary
Unit. Therefore, Railways are requested to book/project proper expenditure in this Primary Unit
with corresponding reduction in the Primary Unit ëSales Taxí.
3.13 It has been observed that some Railways have been booking/projecting expenditure
under the Primary Unit ëChildren Education Allowanceí in all Demands/all Minor Heads of
Demand No.11. It should be booked/ projected only in Demand No.11-Subhead 120-
Reimbursement of Tuition Fees and subsidy.
3.14 To facilitate separate identification of expenditure on arrear payments to staff, the
following primary units have been introduced.
PU-42: Arrear Payments- Salary & Wages.
PU-43: Arrear Payments- Dearness Pay & DA.
PU-44: Arrear Payments- Allowances other than DA.
The Railways may project expenditure under these PUs by showing corresponding
reduction under ëSalary & Wagesí, ëDearness Allowanceí and ëAllowances other than DAí.
3.15 Attention is drawn to ëDemand No.12-Sub head 660- Unpaid wagesí, which had been
replaced by ëSub head 660- Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojanaí. But, few Railways like NR,
NER, NWR & SWR have been booking/projecting expenditure under the old Sub head.
Railways should henceforth book/project expenditure under the new subhead only.
- 5 -
4.0 The Estimates should be accompanied by the following statements:-
4.1 Staff Statements as in Annexure R-3, giving details of Administrative, Senior, Junior
Other Group 'C' Supervisors, Others in Group 'C', Group 'D' and Casual Labour, in the case of all
Demands under the various Minor Heads for Actuals 2011-12, BE 2012-13, RE 2012-13 and BE
2013-14. It must be ensured that the overall figures of staff strength excluding Casual Labour
(D03 to D12) in respect of Actuals 2011-12 should fully reconcile with Statement 40-I (Total
staff on Govt. Railways-Open Line) of the Annual Statistical Statements. Figures of Budget
Estimates 2012-13 should tally with the figures as published in the Demands for Grants, 2012-
13, Part-II.
4.2 Variations in staff strength should be explained on a separate sheet showing
surrenders/creations/filling of vacancies etc. in each Group keeping in view Board's instructions
on man-power planning and for effecting economy in staff cost. The data relating to Staff
Statements are to be furnished through the main Revenue Data Entry package.
4.3 Performance Units of Expenditure in respect of Demands 4 to 12 should be given as
Annexure R-4. Data may be furnished only for those performance units, which are published
in the relevant reports of Demand Book, Part-II so that data furnished by different Railways
are consistent. Further, wherever applicable, the data should be reconciled with that of
Statistics and Analysis Officer. In other cases, these should agree with the records of the
concerned executive officer. Performance Units of expenditure are also covered in the main
Revenue Data Entry package. It is observed that despite repeated requests, the Railways are not
furnishing correct and consistent data. Please ensure that the data are sent as per the correct
format.
4.3.1 Last year, Railways have been asked to furnish Performance Units of expenditure under
Demand No.10- Electric Traction for ëGoods and proportion of mixed GTKMsí also along
with ëPassenger and proportion of mixed GTKMsí. But, most of the Railways have not furnished
the information. Railways are requested to furnish this information from RE 2012-13/BE 2013-14
without fail.
4.4 In respect of Demand 10, traction- wise correlation statement and rates of fuel should
be furnished as Annexure R-5 and R-6 respectively. In the previous years, a few of the
Railways did not furnish these statements despite repeated reminders.
4.5 Production Units, RDSO, Railway Staff College and IRISET may submit their estimates of
Demand No.13 in the manual format as earlier in Annexure R-8.
4.6 All the Zonal Railways are required to take care of these instructions while submitting
estimates of D13 in manual format in respect of Audit Staff.
4.7 Annexure R-3 and R-4 are part of the main Revenue Data Entry Package and are to be
sent in floppies through program only. Other annexure can be sent in manually. (Formats of
Annexure R-1, R-2, R-5, R-6 and R-8 were sent to Railways vide Boards letter No. 2003-B-200
dated 5.11.03).
5.0 Demand 14: Appropriation to Funds: Department-wise position as on 1.4.2011 of staff for
appropriation to Pension Fund, may be sent in the format prescribed vide this Ministryís letter
No. 2003-B-314 dated 19.9.2003.

6.0 Demand 15: Payment of Dividend to General Revenues
6.1 Statement showing capital outlay on Un-remunerative Branch lines, Ore lines, Ferries,
Welfare Buildings and New Lines constructed on or after 1.4.1955 on 'other than financial
consideration' should be submitted.
6.2 Statement furnishing names of other new lines, if any commenced, on or after 1.4.1955,
year-wise, net Capital cost upto 2010-11, net Capital provision in Revised Estimates 2012-13 and
Budget Estimates 2013-14 along-with date of commencement of construction and date of opening
for both Passenger and Goods Traffic, if since opened should be enclosed.
6.3 Profit and Loss Account of all New Lines, which completed moratorium period during
2011-12 and 2012-13, indicating provision for Deferred Dividend in the current year and next
year should be submitted. Amount of Deferred Dividend Estimates to be paid from out of profit
should be clearly indicated in the foot-note of the Profit and Loss Account of the line completing
the moratorium period.
7.0 Works Demand: Grant 16
7.1 Actuals 2011-12, Revised Estimates 2012-13 and Budget Estimates 2013-14 should be
furnished on floppy diskettes/CDs in the new Oracle program accompanied by two hard copies
signed by FA&CAO/Budget. It has been observed that a few Railways/Production Units still do
not enter data in respect of credits and charged appropriation for the coming year Budget
Estimates despite repeated requests, forcing Railway Board to adopt some figures. For a realistic
and accurate budgeting, it is necessary that the planhead-wise data for these is received from the
Railways. Credits likely to be generated as well as the charged appropriation during the years
2012-13 & 2013-14 must, therefore, be estimated and entered in the database in the respective
column of the periods involved. In framing the Estimates, due regard should be given to upto
date progress of expenditure and commitments that are likely to materialise. A new Planhead
í37- Traction Distribution Worksí has been introduced vide Boardís letter No.2011/ACII/3/1
dated 03.04.2012 by modifying/splitting the existing Planhead í36- Other Electrical Worksí.
Railways are advised to submit the Revised Estimates 2012-13 under the existing Planhead
í36- Other Electrical Worksí as well as under new Planhead í37- Traction Distribution Worksí.
7.2 RE 12-13 and BE 13-14 must account for the requirements for projects, other than
Deposit (RVNL), which are figuring in Railways and executed by RVNL.
7.3 It is also seen that some of the Railways are not accounting for the credits properly which
makes the plan size unrealistic and gives rise to instances of last minute changes and / or issuing
of corrigenda after the allotments have been fixed by the Board. The Railways are therefore
advised to avoid such discrepancies in RE 2012-13 projections as well as at other stages in future.
7.4 It should be ensured that under the Plan head 'Inventories', actual expenditure must
match with the schedules already sent to Accounts Directorate of Board's office. There should
not be a variation even of small fraction in gross, credit and net.
7.5 For the internal and mutual co-relation to be maintained in the case of Stores Suspense
and Workshop Manufacture Suspense the computer program generates a statement of the
mismatched items, which should be examined and data rectified before the estimates are
finalised and sent to the Board. ",Government Documents
"7.6 Information in Annexures W-1 to W-15 as detailed in Board's letter no. 93-B-200 dated
05.10.1993 should be furnished along with the Estimates. While furnishing information in
Annexure W-7 regarding Rationalised Building Programme-Details of debits raised/accepted, it
may be ensured that the data for debits raised and credits accepted is properly reconciled with
the concerned Railway before data entry to avoid any duplication, as often it is seen that two
Railways show debits being raised against each other for the same transaction. Reasons for
projections where there is no allotment in original budget and withdrawal of entire allotment, as
is seen in some cases, be compulsorily explained in the appropriate annexure.
7.7 Further while furnishing information in Annexure W-14 regarding staff strength and
expenditure, the Zonal Railway may ensure that for construction organization the details of staff
employed in the Projects only are indicated. It is seen that some of the Railways/Units are not
furnishing the details of staff expenditure in the appropriate format. The deviations noticed
are as under:
(i) Pay & allowance are merged.
(II) Allowance other than TA and Travel expenses are merged.
(III) Figures in respect of either Actuals for previous year or the Budget Estimates for the
next year are omitted.
 In view of the above it is suggested that the staff related figures must be given
separately for the construction organization and Workshops incorporating the data for: (a)
Group ëAí, ëBí, ëCí & ëDí (b) Actuals for previous year, BE for current year, RE for current year
& BE for next year (c) Pay. (d) Allowances other than TA (e) Travelling expenses (f)
Productivity Linked Bonus & (g) Workshop Incentive Bonus.
7.8 The information in regard to write-back adjustments (Annexure W-6) is not being
received properly from some of the Railways, it is requested that this information should be
properly compiled for the current year as well as for the next year (coming year) also, so that
necessary provision on account of write back adjustment may be made in the Budget. In this
connection Board's letter No. F(X)II-93/ ALC/3 dated 17.12.1993 may also be referred to.
8.0 Earnings:
8.1 Traffic earnings for the current year as against the budgeted target may be assessed based
on a critical analysis of the trend of traffic performance and earnings in the first 7 months.
Adverse impact, if any, of the earlier part of the year should not be mechanically projected for
the whole year. Reasons for any variation in projection from the trend should be clearly brought
out in the explanatory note. Similarly, adjustment/waivers etc. affecting the Goods earnings
during the course of the year, should be brought out in the explanatory note in detail. Projection
for the next year may also be made on similar basis.
8.2 The estimates of earnings should be based on anticipated traffic output for a fiscal. The
software developed on Oracle available with all the zonal railways, provides for entering
class/commodity wise data of traffic details for passenger and freight traffic i.e. originating
traffic, lead, rate etc. Based on these inputs the software will generate anticipated earnings. In
case of Other Coaching Earnings a break up of earnings from parcel services, military traffic,
postal haulage, and others may be furnished.
- 8 -
8.3 While the anticipated Traffic Plan and estimates of earnings are to be generated by using
the software, details of monthly originating earnings from passenger, goods and other coaching
traffic etc. are to be furnished in the annexures, indicated below:-
Summarized estimates of earnings
1. Annexure E1 - Traffic Plan (Passenger) } Along with database(.dmp file)
2. Annexure E2 - Traffic Plan (Goods) }
3. Annexure E3 - Monthly details of originating apportioned earnings (actuals for first
 seven months & projection for the remaining part of the fiscal)
4. Annexure E4 - Monthly details of Safety Surcharge collection (actuals for first seven
 months & projection for the remaining part of the fiscal)
5. Annexure E5 - Estimates of Gross traffic Receipts of worked lines (viz. Central
 Province Railway under CR and A.K. Light Railway under ER)
8.4 In the past, most of the zonal railways have not furnished detailed traffic projection
supporting the estimates of earnings. This led to a mismatch in targets of earnings and traffic
output fixed for each zonal railways and this has subsequently been referred to Board by many
zones. It is, therefore, emphasized that detailed inputs of traffic details may be obtained from the
concerned executive branch and estimate of earnings is framed duly projecting the traffic
output. Please note that summarized estimates without detailed
estimates of traffic plan will not be accepted. Prescribed format for Annexure E3 is given on the
following page:-

8.5 The ëOperating losses on strategic linesí being reimbursed by the Ministry of Finance has
become part of ëSundry other earningsí from 2007-08. Profit and loss accounts of individual
strategic lines clearly bringing out the figures of losses/profit for 2011-12, 2012-13(RE), 2013-
14(BE) are required to be furnished by NR, NWR, NFR and WR.
9.0 Civil Estimates
9.1 As provided in Para Nos. 340 to 353 of the Finance Code, Volume-I, detailed requirement
of funds for loans and advances to staff and projection for civil appropriations under IncomeTax, Interest Debt Obligation and various other heads under Abstract F Loan and Advances,
Abstract I Small Savings, Abstract J Reserve Funds, Abstract K Deposits and Advances,
- 9 -
Abstract L Suspense Miscellaneous other accounts and Abstract M - Remittance for the current
fiscal and for the next year may be furnished as per prescribed format (circulated vide Boards
D.O. No.98-B-308 dated 18.11.1998 and also made available to all the new zones).These
information forms part of General Budget and as such, should be furnished to Board in a
consolidated form, not in piece-meal, positively by the stipulated date for timely submission to
Ministry of Finance.
9.2 Ministry of Finance vide letter No.F.2(29)-B(D)/2006 dated 21.9.2006 has asked for a
realistic estimates of interest on provident fund balances to avoid wide variation between the
estimates and actuals, which has been criticized by CAG. Zonal railways are, therefore, required
to frame the estimates of Interest on balances of SRPF, GPF and other deposits under Public
Accounts, duly reviewing the opening balances, actual/anticipated transactions during the
course of the fiscal. Any variation should be explained in detailed supported with related data.
The information pertaining to Group D staff which is incorporated in the estimates should be
furnished separately in a Annexure.

"IN INTERNET DOMAIN NAME
POLICY FRAMEWORK & IMPLEMENTATION
1. Background
1.1 Globally, there are approximately 60 million Internet domain names
registered. Of these, about 40 million are in generic top level domain (gtld)
category, while the remaining 20 million are in country code top level domain (cctld)
category. The administration of gtld rests with the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN), an internationally organized non profit corporation,
with membership from different countries and experts in the field. The responsibility
for administration of cctld, on the other hand, has been entrusted to the individual
countries who in general follow the guidelines provided by ICANN. These Internet
domain names are used by the user entities to identify them in the networked
Internet space. In the gtld category, .com and .net domains are the most popular,
and have registered in largest numbers. In recent times, the cctld domain
registrations are growing with the countries playing active role in the Internet space
1.2 The system of registration of Internet domain names can facilitate the
proliferation of Internet in a country. The number of registrations of Internet domain
names in a country is also a measure of its popularity in the Internet space. Many
countries have therefore adopted liberal and market friendly policies to register large
number of Internet domain names under their country code, broadly consistent with
global policy and procedures of domain registration. Recently, some of the countries
have brought about significant changes to their registration policies & procedures,
which has led to a substantial increase in the number of domains registered in a
short period of time.
1.3 In India, just under 7000 domains have been registered by the Registry at 2nd
and 3rd levels under .IN country code over the past decade or so. In addition, the
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have registered about 500,000 .IN domain names
at the 3rd level. This number does not truly represent the penetration of Information
Technology (IT) in India when compared with a number of companies and public
institutions engaged in IT and IT enabled services (ITeS). The slow growth of .IN
domain has been adjudged to be largely due to the absence of contemporary
processes and infrastructure, and an over cautious registration policy followed.

 1.4 The National Centre for Software Technology (NCST), now merged into
the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing ( C-DAC ), was the de facto
Registry for .IN domain up to 1997, and became de jure Registry subsequently.
1.5 It is widely recognised that .IN domain name has untapped growth potential.
A proactive policy for .IN domain proliferation can establish the .IN as a globally
recognized symbol of Indiaís growth and developments in the area of information
technology.
2. Adopting New Policy Framework
2.1 Internet domain names have assumed greater significance in the recent times
with Internet increasingly being used as an effective medium for commerce,
education, governance and communication. In order, therefore, to have a larger
presence in the Internet space, a forward looking policy for registration under
country code Top Level Domain (ccTLD) will help in its proliferation as all Indian
residents, government entities, public service organizations and businesses will be
able to establish their Indian identity in the Internet space with a short and unique
domain name.

2.2 A policy would mainly determine how conveniently a cctld name could be
registered and maintained for the large number of Internet subscribers and
addresses. It will need to address, among other questions, the following:
ï What are the domains available for registration?
ï Are there any restrictions in registering domain names?
ï Where can domain names be registered ñ including whether there is a single
source or a distributed chain of Registrars?
ï What prices are charged for registration, and what services do registrants
receive in turn?
ï Why a registrant would prefer to register in cctld - rather than a gtld?
ï Is the process of registration simple, efficient, and reliable?
2.3 Apart from the policy, any Registry would also need to meet the following
criteria:
Security Registries should be resistant to hacking, and must also
withstand denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The hardware and
software requirements for such secure systems are high.
Reliability Various user entities ñ government, businesses, citizens ñ rely
on the Web sites and e-mail messaging that domain names
enable. A Registry should provide reliable service, with 100%
uptime.
Scalability The Registry infrastructure should accommodate growth without
interruptions.
Adherence to The Internet functions well only when the concerned
Technical agencies collaborate to create and maintain
Standards interoperable technical standards. Registry should adhere
to such standards and practices announced by ICANN.
2.4 Other countries of comparable size and exposure to Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT) have adopted a decentralized organizational
structure, liberal policies, and a comprehensive dispute resolution mechanism,
deployed state-of-the-art infrastructure, and used the private- public partnership to
market Domain Name Registration Services (DNS), resulting in phenomenal growth
of their country code domain name.
2.5 In order, therefore, to proliferate .IN domain name, a policy framework is
instituted, which is open and market friendly, to help brand .IN in a big way and
achieve its rightful place in the Internet space that it deserves.
3. .IN Domain Name Policy Framework &
Implementation
3.1 The policy under the new framework for implementation of .IN Registry
focuses on creating liberal, efficient and market friendly processes and a distributed
organizational structure.
3.2 The National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI), a not-for-profit company
under Section 25 of Indian Companies Act 1956 promoted by the Department of
Information Technology (DIT) in association with the Internet Service providers
Association of India (ISPAI), has been entrusted with the responsibility of setting up
the Registry for .IN country code top level domain name (ccTLD). For this the NIXI
will create the .IN Network Information Centre (INNIC) to operate as a Registry for
.IN domain in India.
3.3 With the implementation of the new policy by INNIC under NIXI, a 100,000
.IN domain name registrations at the end of 1st of its operation year has been
targeted , with an average annual growth of 50% over a couple of years thereafter.
3.4 Major Policy Elements
 The major elements of the new policy are as follows:
3.4.1 Unlimited generic .IN registration will be open to public at 2nd level
3.4.2 Unlimited generic 3rd level registrations will also be open to public, e.g.
in certain popular zones like .co.in, .net.in, .org.in, etc.
3.4.3 The zones .gov.in, .mil.in and .ac & .edu.in will be reserved for the
Government, Defence and Educational institutions respectively. The
registrations at the 3rd level in these zones will be carried out by the
Government, or an institution identified by the Government. Taking
into account the Internet services offered in their respective sectors,
.gov.in registration will be handled by NIC, .ac.in & .edu.in by ERNET
and .mil.in by a Defence organization suggested by the Ministry of
Defence (MOD), as Registrars in these zones.
3.4.4 State Governments and Union Territories can register under .gov.in
category. They are also free to register at 2nd level using a two letter
nomenclature adopted by the Transport Department. The City
administrations will be open to register at 3rd level either with the
State or under .gov.in category.
3.4.5 One or two character domain registration will not be allowed at the 2nd
and 3rd levels for use by the general public.
3.4.6 Prior to the opening of registration at 2nd/3rd levels, following category
of names will be reserved.
ï Constitutional Authorities
ï States/ Union Territories/ Cities
ï Specific Names for Registry use
3.4.7 Trademark owners, registered companies and owners of intellectual
property have a legitimate interest in protecting their brand. In the
Internet domain, it is achieved by having a ìSunrise Periodî. A Sunrise
period of 90 days from the opening of registration at 2nd/3rd levels will
be announced during which genuine registrations with proper
verification will be allowed as per the policy for these registrations,
with first preference given to Indian entities. Thereafter, the
registrations will be open to public on first come first served basis.
3.4.8 The .IN Registry will have authority to deny or suspend the registration
to any one if it conflicts with the sovereign national interest or public
order.
3.4.9 The .IN Registry may also open newly created generic top level zones,
e.g .biz, .info, .coop, .pro, for offering registrations under these
categories under .IN domain name.
3.4.10 A comprehensive Dispute Resolution Policy (DRP) will be adopted in
line with internationally accepted guidelines prescribed by the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and Universal Dispute
Resolution Policy (UDRP) adopted by the ICANN. This will be in line
with the relevant provisions of the Indian IT Act 2000.
3.4.11 Any dispute involving the .IN Registry will be considered by a duly
appointed Dispute Resolution Committee.
3.4.12 The .IN Registry would also appoint Arbitrators, through a process of
open selection, who can be approached by any aggrieved party (ies)
for redressal of grievance with the Registrars. The decision of the
Arbitrator shall be binding on both the parties. A Service Fee will be
prescribed which will be required to be paid to the Arbitrator by the
aggrieved party for such arbitration.

3.4.13 Government of India will be the final authority for .IN domain name
policy. This will ensure its administration in accordance with the public
interest and relevant laws of the country.
3.5 Institutional Framework
The following will be the institutional framework of the .IN Registry:
3.5.1 The .IN Registry will be a Not-for-Profit organization, and will function
as an autonomous body, accountable to the Government. Its
responsibility will be to maintain .IN domain to ensure its operational
stability, reliability and security.
3.5.2 An executive order through a gazette notification will be issued by the
Department of Information Technology (DIT), Government of India
according a legal status to the Registry for .IN domain in India. It will
also mention the role of National Informatics Centre (NIC), ERNET and
the nominated Defence Organization as Registrars for handling
.gov.in, .edu.in & .ac.in and .mil.in registrations respectively.
3.5.3 The .IN Registry by itself will not carry out registrations. It will do so
through a number of Registrars to be appointed by it through an open
process of selection on the basis of transparent eligibility criteria.

3.5.4 The Registrars will either be an ISP themselves who are connected to the
National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI), or use the services of such
ISP who is connected to NIXI.
3.6 Implementation Mechanism
The implementation mechanism for registration by the .IN Registry will be as under:
3.6.1 The Registrars appointed by the Registry will pay a one time nonrefundable entry fee of Rs. 50,000/-.
3.6.2 The Registrars will, in addition, deposit a minimum amount of Rs. 25,000/-
in their account with the Registry based on which they will be authorized to
perform domain name transactions, and continue to do so as long as they
had amount in their account with the Registry. Once the amount
deposited is exhausted, they would automatically be disabled to perform
transactions until they have replenished their account. The minimum
amount for replenishment will be Rs. 25,000/-.
3.6.3 The Registrars will be charged Rs. 500/- per domain name for 2nd level
and Rs 250/- for 3rd level domain name by the Registry for registration
valid for a period of one year. A Registrar may also register a domain
name up to a maximum of 5 years by paying the applicable registration
amount of Rs. 2500/- or Rs 1250/- respectively to the .IN Registry.
3.6.4 The .IN Registry in consultation with the Government will review the .IN
domain name pricing structure as and when necessitated.
3.6.5 The Registrars, on the basis of their agreement with the Registry, will
market and sell the .IN domain name, and provide requisite services to the
registrants using competitive pricing policy and best market practices.
3.6.6 The entire registration process will be online, including any document
submission, and payment for registration. The .IN domain name will be
registered within 24 hours of the request from the registrant, and the .IN
Registry will put in place procedures to ensure that the Registrars do not
unduly delay transmission of registration requests from the registrants to
the Registrar.
3.6.7 The .IN Registry will have a 24/7 state-of-the-art technical infrastructure
for .IN domain name registration for maintenance of data bases and
providing requisite registration services in conjunction with the Registrars.
3.6.8 The .IN Registry will approach Government Departments, service
organizations, businesses etc. to progressively adopt .IN domain name by
them for their websites and personnel. ",Government Documents

1.1 LIFELINE UDAN
1.2 REGIONAL CONNECTIVITY SCHEME (RCS) ñ UDE
DESH KA AAM NAGRIK (UDAN)
Ministry of Civil Aviation launched 'Lifeline UDAN' on
26.03.2020 during pandemic COVID-19, when
scheduled domestic flight operations were
suspended from 25th March, 2020. Lifeline UDAN
was an initiative to ensure a steady supply of
essentials as well as medical supplies, PPEs (Personal
Protective Equipment), test kits etc. to all parts of the
country. For this purpose, the Ministry facilitated
establishing Lifeline UDAN mechanism to match the
requirements /consignments of States /UTs/MoHFW
(HLL & ICMR)/other Ministries with special flight
plans.
588 flights were operated under Lifeline Udan
operations by Air India, Alliance Air, Pawan Hans
Limited and some private airlines till 28th May, 2020.
Approximately 1000 ton of cargo was transported by
the Lifeline Udan flights covering an aerial distance of
5,45,000 Kms. The focus of the Lifeline Udan was on
North Eastern region, the Islands and the hilly
terrains. Lifeline Udan flights ensured quick
movement of medical supplies, medical teams,
setting up of COVID labs and RTPCR machines across
the country. Lifeline Udan flights were also used to fly
specialists, chemicals and equipment to
Vishakapatnam after the gas leak tragedy.
The Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - Ude Desh
Ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN) was launched on 21.10.2016.
The first RCS-UDAN flight was inaugurated by Honíble
Prime Minister on 27th April, 2017.
303 routes connecting airports across the length and
breadth of the country have commenced.
Within 3 years, 53 airports including 5 heliports and 2
water aerodromes have been developed and
operationalized under UDAN as compared to 76
airports that have been developed in 70 years since
independence.
Over five million passengers have travelled on UDAN
flights, as on the end of November 2020.
Newer modes of air transportation have been
1. HIGHLIGHTS
introduced under UDAN including seaplanes,
helicopters, flights via smaller aircrafts.
UDAN helped airline operators in developing
sustainable business models and helped provide
start-up and scale-up opportunities to small regional
airlines.
UDAN led to a virtuous cycle with growth of
profitable routes leading to more UDAN flights, which
facilitate increased demand and growth for profitable
routes.
UDAN has enhanced quality of life by providing
enhanced comfort and reduced travel time at
affordable prices to the common man. A large
number of first-time flyers have been able to take to
the skies due to UDAN.
UDAN has also enabled provision of fast medical
services including transport of medical supplies,
personnel etc. in remote regions which is critical in
times of emergency. This was evident by operation
Lifeline UDAN undertaken during the COVID-19
pandemic.
UDAN has provided an impetus to economic
development of remote regions and contributed to a
more equitable and inclusive growth in economic
activity across the country.

Bhubaneswar, Indore, Raipur and Trichy for
Operation, Management and Development
under PPP. A decision has been taken to club
each of the 6 airports with a nearby smaller
airport for PPP. This would require amendment
of AERA Act as the present Act provides for tariff
determination for single airport and not for
group of airports. AAI has been asked to proceed
accordingly.

1.4 UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM (DRONE)
1.5 THE VANDE BHARAT MISSION (VBM)
parts of the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The mission involves a massive operation organized
by the Government of India to repatriate Indian
nationals by air, sea and land routes. The VBM also
enables individuals of various nationalities stuck in
India to return to their respective countries and
continues to do so.
This landmark mission is being carried out with the
active support and cooperation of MEA and Indian
Missions abroad, MoCA, MHA, MoH&FW and State
Governments. The Air India group (Air India and Air
India Express) has been the backbone of the VBM
while the private Indian carriers viz. GoAir, IndiGo,
SpiceJet and Vistara are active participants too. The
private airlines joined VBM in Phase III. By the sheer
number of passengers and also by number of
countries covered, it is the biggest evacuation
exercise by civilian authorities in the world. The
airlines deserve further credit for this job since the
operation was subjected to strict precautions
relating to COVID-19 laid down by MHA and
MoH&FW.
Under VBM, Air India/Air India Express has covered
more than 50 countries. Even such countries have
been covered where Air India/Air India Express do
not fly in the normal course. So far, they have
brought back lakhs of Indians from various parts of
the world. The Indian private carriers have also been
roped in during the third phase for evacuation of
Indians under the VBM. The private carriers have
operated to the Gulf countries, Malaysia, Philippines
and Singapore so far. Apart from VBM, repatriation
has also taken place through charter flights by
private Indian carriers and foreign carriers. The State
Governments have also played a crucial role in this
exercise in as much as to ensure necessary
quarantine and other arrangements.
""Air Transport Bubblesî or ìAir Travel Arrangementsî
are temporary arrangements between two
countries aimed at restarting commercial passenger
services when regular international flights are
suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
They are reciprocal in nature, meaning airlines from
both countries enjoy similar benefits.
As on 31.12.2020, we have Air Bubble arrangements
with 24 countries viz. Afghanistan, Bahrain,",Government Documents
