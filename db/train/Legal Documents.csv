"The general principles governing the exercise of the discretion to award indemnity costs after rejection by an unsuccessful party of a so called Calderbank letter were set out in the judgment of the Full Court in Black v Lipovac [1998] FCA 699 ; (1998) 217 ALR 386. In summary those principles are: 1. Mere refusal of a ""Calderbank offer"" does not itself warrant an order for indemnity costs. In this connection it may be noted that Jessup J in Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 42 said that (at [6]): if the rejection of such an offer is to ground a claim for indemnity costs, it must be by reason of some circumstance other than that the offer happened to comply with the Calderbank principle. 2. To obtain an order for indemnity costs the offeror must show that the refusal to accept it was unreasonable. 3. The reasonableness of the conduct of the offeree is to be viewed in the light of the circumstances that existed when the offer was rejected.",Legal Documents,,,
"The preceding general principles inform the exercise of the discretion. That discretion is not to be fettered by transformation of approaches and practices developed through the cases into quasi statutory rules. In John S Hayes &amp; Associates Pty Ltd v Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 201 , Hill J said (at 203): care must be taken not to circumscribe the discretion by reference to closed categories. It is not a necessary condition of the power to award costs that a collateral purpose be shown. The categories warranting the exercise of the discretion are not closed ...

"On the question of the level of unreasonableness necessary to attract the discretion, I respectfully agree with the comment of Sackville J in Seven Network Limited v News Limited (2007) 244 ALR 374 at [62] questioning the utility of substituting a requirement that rejection be ""plainly unreasonable"" for the requirement that it be ""unreasonable"". Given the evaluative character of the judgment involved the addition of the word ""plainly"" which is itself evaluative, has no useful function. 37 At the time that Sirtex made its offer to UWA the prospect of UWA succeeding against Sirtex depended critically upon: 1. UWA establishing its case against Dr Gray and, in particular, that he had breached his fiduciary duty. 2. UWA establishing that Sirtex was accessorially liable in relation to that breach, a position that depended upon establishing that Sirtex was aware of facts constituting (and which would have indicated to a reasonable person) the breach of fiduciary duties owed by Dr Gray to UWA. 38 It cannot be said that UWA acted unreasonably in proceeding on the basis that it had a reasonable cause of action against Dr Gray. True it is that the case as framed and presented depended upon an important proposition of law as to the existence of an implied term in the contract of Dr Gray's employment with UWA. But the correctness of that proposition had not previously been tested in Australia in circumstances of the kind which arose in this case. This is not a case, in my opinion, in which it is appropriate to take a hindsight test to the facts known to UWA at the time of Sirtex's offer and conclude that it ought to have known that the law was against it. 39 There were of course other hazards in the way of UWA's path to success against Dr Gray and therefore against Sirtex. The question whether the relevant inventions were made while Dr Gray was an employee of UWA was one issue upon which findings adverse to UWA were made on all but the DOX-Spheres technology. There was also a finding adverse to UWA that none of the Sirtex directors, apart from Dr Gray, were on notice of a potential claim. To establish any cause of action against Sirtex based on knowing involvement in his alleged breaches of fiduciary duty would have depended entirely upon his role as a director of Sirtex and whether his knowledge could be attributed to that company. In addition, UWA faced substantial defences by Sirtex based on UWA's delay in commencing proceedings after it first became aware of the facts relevant to its claimed causes of action. 40 The preceding factors may be seen as weighing to some degree in favour of the Sirtex motion. On the other hand the offer came as the trial commenced. That is a factor, given the focus on the trial process which would then have existed, that militates against a finding of unreasonableness on the part of UWA in refusing the offer. That conclusion is not affected by the fact that Sirtex was making a counter-offer. The counter-offer was not a variation on a theme opened by UWA's offers. It was quite different and could have been proposed earlier.",Legal Documents,,,
"recent decision of the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 clarifies this issue. Gleeson CJ and Crennan J (at [19]), after referring to various cases dealing with the grant of interlocutory injunctions in cases of defamation, formulated the general principles governing the grant of such relief in the following terms: ""in all applications for an interlocutory injunction, a court will ask whether the plaintiff has shown that there is a serious question to be tried as to the plaintiff's entitlement to relief, has shown that the plaintiff is likely to suffer injury for which damages will not be an adequate remedy, and has shown that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction.""",Legal Documents,,,

"Strictly speaking, a cheque, even a bank cheque, is not a form of legal tender. Subject to some particular contractual or statutory provision, the only forms of legal tender remain Australian notes or, subject to the limits specified, Australian coins see s 36 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and s 16 of the Currency Act 1965 respectively. However, in general trade and commerce, as Mason J observed in George v Cluning (1979) 53 ALJR 767 (note) by reference to Canadian authority, a payment by cheque can amount to sufficient payment if not objected to on that account. In this case there was no objection made by the Deputy Commissioner on account of Ganter's endeavouring to settle its indebtedness by the tendering of a cheque only, as I have noted a signification that it was accepted subject to a condition that the cheque would be paid on presentation",Legal Documents,,,
"None of this is to suggest that the Deputy Commissioner was under any obligation to accept the proffered cheque. When the history of Ganter's endeavours to pay the debt after the filing of the winding up application is recalled and that the company was, by operation of s 459C(2)(a) the Corporations Act 2001 presumed to be insolvent the Deputy Commissioner would have been entitled not to accept the cheque. A refusal to accept the cheque would not have eliminated the debt in question: Australian Mid-Eastern Club Ltd v Yassim (1989) 1 ACSR 399 , at 403 (NSWCA); Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 830 at [3] per Gyles J.",Legal Documents,,,
"None of this is to suggest that the Deputy Commissioner was under any obligation to accept the proffered cheque. When the history of Ganter's endeavours to pay the debt after the filing of the winding up application is recalled and that the company was, by operation of s 459C(2)(a) the Corporations Act 2001 presumed to be insolvent the Deputy Commissioner would have been entitled not to accept the cheque. A refusal to accept the cheque would not have eliminated the debt in question: Australian Mid-Eastern Club Ltd v Yassim (1989) 1 ACSR 399 , at 403 (NSWCA); Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 830 at [3] per Gyles J. 21 In my opinion, the date for the determination of standing to apply for the winding up of a company is the date when the application is made. As it was when Motor Terms v Liberty Insurance (supra) was decided, the process for the winding up of a company remains today entirely statutory. By s 459A(1)(b) of the Corporations Act a creditor is one of the persons who may apply for the winding up of a company. The application for the winding up of Ganter was made by the Deputy Commissioner upon the filing of the application in this Court on 20 August 2008. At that time, the Deputy Commissioner was, on any view, a creditor. Like Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (at [5]), I am not persuaded that there is any requirement flowing from the Corporations Act that the applicant must continue to be a creditor at the time when the winding up application is heard. As his Honour there states (ibid), and though it is cited in a number of cases which he notes, the passage from the judgement of Menzies J in Motor Terms v Liberty Insurance (supra) does not support the existence of any such requirement. 22 The true position is that the applicant's status as a creditor at the time when the application was made and the presumption flowing from the company's failure to comply with the terms of a statutory demand are sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction to order the winding up of the company. That was the conclusion reached by Zeeman J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Guy Holdings Pty Ltd (1994) 116 FLR 314 at 318. As did Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (at [6]), I agree with that conclusion. As Zeeman J observed in the Guy Holdings Case (at 320), ""in the case of an application under s 459P where the debt the subject of the statutory demand has been paid after the filing of the application, the application ought to be dismissed unless there is established some positive reason that a winding up order ought to be made"". His Honour is there referring to the way in which, in those circumstances, the discretion vested in the Court on the hearing of a winding up application by s 467 of the Corporations Act would ordinarily be exercised. 24 In their submissions the solicitors for the company pointed to the observation made by Gyles J in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (at [8]), ""With trading companies the existence of a winding up proceeding is a very serious inhibition and has very serious impacts"". I respectfully agree. That is one reason why it behoves a company which wishes to keep trading to pay its debts as they fall due or at least later to comply with the terms of a statutory demand. It is also a reason why, all other things being equal, a Court would be disposed, as a matter of discretion, to dismiss a winding up application if satisfied that the debt owed to the applicant creditor had been paid. Another consideration not to be ignored is the protection of the revenue. Yet another consideration is that Ganter, by its solicitors, initially agreed with the Deputy Commissioner's proposal that on 13 November 2008 the adjournment of the application for one week ought to be sought. A further consideration is the public interest in whether a company which is presumed to be insolvent ought to be permitted to continue to trade or whether it ought to be wound up. 25 Ganter's change of heart as to the course which ought to be taken on 13 November 2008 seems to have been multi-factorial in origin. Inferentially from the submissions made to me and to the District Registrar it was founded upon what I regard as the misapprehension that the payment of an applicant creditor's debt obliged the Court to dismiss a winding up application, as opposed to that being a factor going to discretion. Likewise, it seems to have been grounded on the belief that the acceptance of the bank cheque by the Deputy Commissioner extinguished the debt then and there, as opposed to so doing upon the fulfilment of the condition subsequent of the cheque's being cleared. Further, it seems to have been grounded upon the belief that, the cheque payment having been recorded as a credit on 11 November 2008 in its accounts, the Deputy Commissioner was obliged, as a ""model litigant"" to agree to the dismissal of the winding up application on 13 November 2008. 26 This, with respect, misapprehends the obligation that falls on those representing the interests of the Crown in civil litigation. One of those interests, and it is a vital interest, is the protection of the revenue. The Deputy Commissioner would certainly have failed in his duty to the Court as a model litigant had the acceptance of the cheque and the terms upon which it had been accepted not been drawn to the Court's attention on 13 November 2008. It was. Especially as matters then stood as to the clearing of the bank cheque and the Deputy Commissioner's knowledge as to the practice of the NAB in relation to the circumstances in which it would not meet a bank cheque and the time within which any such disposition on the part of the bank would usually be signified, it was not unreasonable for the Deputy Commissioner to resist the dismissal of the application that day. The position then to take was a matter for the value judgement of the Deputy Commissioner in the circumstances in the administration of the taxation laws. The entry in the accounts of the ATO had no more than a provisional quality about it.",Legal Documents,,,

"There is a variety of ways in which the interests of persons, to whom liabilities may be owed, can be protected by orders made under the section. The nature of the protection can vary according to the nature of the risks assessed. As Palmer J said in ASIC v Mauer-Swisse Securities Ltd (2002) 20 ACLC 1530 at [37]: '... there may be evidence to suggest that fraud has been perpetrated on a large scale and that many of the victims have no or little information about the extent of the fraud, no or little means for their own investigations, and no or little resources to prosecute their own claims. In such a case, the interests of such persons are protected, within the contemplation of s 1323, by enabling ASIC to conduct an investigation for the purpose of identifying the wrongdoers and exposing them not only to penalties under the Corporations Act and other legislation, but also to claims for compensation from the victims themselves.' `",Legal Documents,,,
"The orders that can be made under the section are directed, inter alia, to the preservation of assets against which recovery may be sought in the event that liability to an 'aggrieved person' is established on the part of a 'relevant person'. The orders are made in circumstances where 'an investigation is being carried out', 'a prosecution has been begun' or 'a civil proceeding has been begun'. That is to say the orders can be made before liability is established and indeed before the evidence necessary to establish liability has been collected. While an application under the section is not interlocutory in an existing criminal or civil proceeding, it is interlocutory in a wider sense. It preserves the status quo and the assets of the relevant person pending the outcome of the investigation, prosecution or civil proceedings which are on foot CAC v Lone Star Exploration NL( No 2) (1988) 14 ACLR 499 at 504. At the stage an order is sought the Court may not be in a position to identify with precision any particular liability owed by the person the subject of the proposed order. This consideration applies to final orders made under the section as well as to interim orders for which it expressly provides in s 1323(3). The final orders made under the section are necessarily of a temporary or holding character rather than finally disposing of the rights and liabilities of the relevant persons affected by them.",Legal Documents,,,
"The circumstances in which the Court may make orders under s 1323(1) are wide as indicated by the words 'necessary or desirable ... for the purpose of protecting the interests of a person ...'. There is an element of risk assessment and risk management in the judgment the Court is called on to make. It follows, and has been accepted, that there is no requirement on the part of ASIC to demonstrate a prima facie case of liability on the part of the relevant person or that the person's assets have been or are about to be dissipated Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd (1989) 7 ACLC 467 at 476 (Powell J); Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Adler (2001) 38 ACSR 266 at [7] (Santow J).",Legal Documents,,,
"It is not a necessary consequence of an order appointing a receiver that the receiver should deal with or liquidate the assets in question. The interlocutory and protective character of orders made under s 1323 must be borne in mind when defining the powers of the receiver. The appointment of a receiver has rightly been described as 'an extraordinary step' ASIC v Burke [2000] NSWSC 694 at [8] (Austin J). However depending upon the nature of the powers conferred on the receiver it may be less drastic than a freezing order which can only be varied by order of the Court. The interlocutory history of this case has already demonstrated that circumstances not contemplated when the original interim freezing orders were made have required their variation from time to time. I accept, with respect, the observation made by Austin J in Burke at [8]: 'Without wishing to lay down any general rules, it appears to me that the extraordinary step of appointing a receiver may be justified, even though Mareva Orders are in place, in a case where there is real doubt about the existence and location of assets such as investments, and about the number and identity of claimants and the nature of their claims, and additionally the defendants are engaged in business activities which entail that any Mareva Orders must allow assets to be turned over in the course of business. Where these circumstances exist in combination, and especially where there are allegations of serious fraud involved, the Court may conclude ...that the Mareva Orders are not enough to ensure that the assets are preserved and protected, and indeed identified and brought in for the benefit of investors.' The decision was cited with approval by Santow J in ASIC v Adler (supra) at 268-269. 30 Section 1323 does not make any express provision for the nature of the evidence on which the Court may act in making orders under it. Applications made under the section have an interlocutory character albeit there are no other specific proceedings to which they may relate. The section does not require concluded findings of fact about liability or whether assets have been dissipated. For the reasons already canvassed the Court, in making orders under s 1323 , engages in a risk assessment and management process. The logic of the section assumes that the Court will not always have before it evidence of the kind that would be necessary and admissible in proceedings to establish definitively the nature and extent of the assets of the persons under investigation and their liability to aggrieved persons. Nor will it necessarily have before it evidence of the kind that would establish definitively that dissipation of assets has occurred or is likely to occur or that flight is imminent. 31 The logic of s 1323 requires the Court to be able to act on evidence which might not be admissible in civil or criminal proceedings leading to a definitive determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties. Hearsay evidence may therefore be received and acted upon, not as proof of the truth of its content but as evidence of the existence of a risk or possibility that gives rise to the necessity for or desirability of a protective order. It is not necessary, in this context, to consider whether the proceedings are interlocutory for the purposes of the exception to the hearsay rule under s 75 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) albeit that that exception is no doubt informed by similar considerations. Evidence may be received of the opinion of a suitably qualified person who has had the opportunity to review extensive documentation collected in the course of an investigation and to offer an overview of it for the benefit of the Court. In such a case the opinion or overview should be supported by reference to the relevant documentation and factual material. The opinion is received not for the determination of any ultimate issue of liability but as probative of the risk which the Court must assess in determining whether to make an order under the section. These considerations are relevant to the admissibility of some of the affidavit evidence which has been relied upon in this case. 32 Specific objection has been taken on behalf of the second defendant to the use of transcripts of examinations conducted under s 19 of the ASIC Act. It was submitted that pursuant to s 68(3) of the ASIC Act such transcripts are not admissible in evidence against the person who has signed the record in a proceeding for the imposition of a penalty. It was submitted that the present proceedings are, in truth, proceedings for the imposition of a penalty. This is on the basis that if interlocutory in nature, then they are interlocutory in respect of proceedings not yet commenced but which will inevitably be penalty proceedings. 33 Accepting that there is a possibility that penalty proceedings may be taken against one or more of the defendants in this case that does not, in my opinion, render the present application an application for the imposition of a penalty or an application incidental to such proceeding. As already noted, evidence may be relied upon of a hearsay or opinion character in these proceedings which might not be admissible in penalty proceedings. The same is true for s 19 transcripts. 34 It was submitted for the second defendant that because ASIC seeks an order that the reasonable costs of the receivers and managers whose appointment it seeks should be payable from the collective assets of the defendants, that fact itself gives the present application the character of a penalty proceeding. In my opinion however, the submission is misconceived. An order for the payment of costs out of the collective assets of the defendants would not of itself amount to the imposition of a penalty. Although it may effectively deprive defendants of some of their property that imposition is not by way of punishment for any contravention of the law. 35 Objection was also taken to the admissibility against the second defendant of transcripts of examinations of other parties conducted under s 19 of the ASIC Act. In this respect s 77 of the ASIC Act was relied upon. That section provides: 'Where direct evidence by a person (the absent witness ) of a matter would be admissible in a proceeding, a statement that the absent witness made at an examination of the absent witness and that tends to establish that matter is admissible in the proceeding as evidence of that matter: (a) if it appears to the court or tribunal that: (i) the absent witness is dead or is unfit, because of physical or mental incapacity, to attend as a witness; or (ii) the absent witness is outside the State or Territory in which the proceeding is being heard and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his or her attendance; or (iii) all reasonable steps have been taken to find the absent witness but he or she cannot be found; or (b) if it does not so appear to the court or tribunal unless another party to the proceeding requires the party tendering evidence of the statement to call the absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and the tendering party does not so call the absent witness.' It was submitted for the second defendant that ASIC has not adduced evidence in respect of the matters set out in s 77(a) and that therefore the s 19 transcripts of those parties that are not parties to the proceeding may only be tendered if the conditions set out in par (a) are set out. Counsel for ASIC on the other hand submitted that the second defendant had not required ASIC to call any absent witness as a witness in the proceeding and that therefore the condition of admissibility under s 77(b) of the Act was satisfied. Given the urgency with which the application has been made, it is perhaps a little unrealistic to require advance notice by the second defendant of the requirement that any absent witness whose s 19 transcript is relied upon be called as a witness in the proceeding. In my opinion, however, the transcripts of the examinations conducted under s 19 can be relied upon as tending to establish the possibility that circumstances exist which give rise to the necessity or desirability of a protective order. What is in evidence here is the fact that the statement was made in the course of a s 19 examination. The fact that the statement was made, rather like the hearsay evidence referred to earlier, may support an inference that circumstances exist that make a protective order necessary or desirable. It is not necessary to rely upon such evidence for the purpose of establishing the truth of the statement made.",Legal Documents,,,
"In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at 574 ("" Pegasus ""), Davies AJ addressed the question whether the sole director of the company which promoted and operated a managed investment scheme should also be considered to be a person operating the scheme. His Honour said at [55]-[57]: ""The word 'operate' is an ordinary word of the English language and, in the context, should be given its meaning in ordinary parlance. The term is not used to refer to ownership or proprietorship but rather to the acts which constitute the management of or the carrying out of the activities which constitute the managed investment scheme. The Oxford English Dictionary gives these relevant meanings: 5. To effect or produce by action or the exertion of force or influence; to bring about, accomplish, work. 6. To cause or actuate the working of; to work (a machine, etc). Chiefly U.S. 7. To direct the working of; to manage, conduct, work (a railway, business, etc); to carry out or through, direct to an end (a principle, an undertaking, etc) orig. U.S. I have concluded that Mr McKim operated the managed investment scheme. He was the living person who formulated and directed the scheme and he was actively involved in its day to day operations. He supervised others in their performance. I have also concluded that Mr McKim is not exempted by s601ED(6). He did not 'merely' act as agent or employee of Pegasus. He was the directing mind and will of Pegasus and of the scheme."" 35 Mansfield J reached a similar conclusion in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488. In that case, the individual in question was one of the directors of the company managing the scheme. His Honour found that the person in question formulated and directed the scheme, and was actively involved in its day to day operations as the directing mind and will of the company managing the scheme. Accordingly, he was operating the scheme in contravention of s 601EB(5). In making these findings, Mansfield J approved the passage in Pegasus to which I have referred. 55 Since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW ) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121, esp at 125, the courts have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important law enforcement purposes: see Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) NSWLR 596 at 603; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 at [30] - [31] ; and Pegasus at 571. ASIC is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Act , and there will be many cases where it is in the public interest for the courts to make a declaration on ASIC's application that the Act has been contravened in specified respects. The making of such a declaration does not simply record the outcome of enforcement proceedings; it may also be an appropriate way of marking the court's disapproval of the contravening conduct: see Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 80 at 97-99, 106 and 110. 77 ASIC does not seek an order that BTS be wound up, even though there is some evidence that it might be insolvent. In many cases, it may be appropriate, and it may further investor protection, to make winding up orders in respect of both the unregistered managed investment scheme and the company which administered the scheme: see Pegasus at 579-580, at [95] [98]. Indeed, in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Chase Capital Management Pty Ltd (2001) 36 ACSR 778 at 796, Owen J said at [93] that if an unregistered scheme is to be wound up, the case for a liquidation of the company that conducted it is compelling.",Legal Documents,,,
"MultiCultural Affairs Mansfield J reached a similar conclusion in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488. In that case, the individual in question was one of the directors of the company managing the scheme. His Honour found that the person in question formulated and directed the scheme, and was actively involved in its day to day operations as the directing mind and will of the company managing the scheme. Accordingly, he was operating the scheme in contravention of s 601EB(5). In making these findings, Mansfield J approved the passage in Pegasus to which I have referred. 74 In ASIC v Takaran Pty Ltd (No 2) (2003) 194 ALR 743 at 747-748, at [15], Barrett J made the following observation, with which I agree: ""The fact that a scheme is being operated by its existing operators in contravention of statute activates a public interest in favour of not only its being wound up under s 601EE ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488) but also 'ensuring the transparency of the winding up process and the safeguarding of the rights of the contributories' by committing the winding up to an independent party ( Bells Securities Pty Ltd v LPG Mourant [2002] QSC 156 ; BC200202989 per Wilson J; see also Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Product Management Group Pty Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 343).""",Legal Documents,,,

"Since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW ) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121, esp at 125, the courts have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important law enforcement purposes: see Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) NSWLR 596 at 603; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 at [30] - [31] ; and Pegasus at 571. ASIC is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Act , and there will be many cases where it is in the public interest for the courts to make a declaration on ASIC's application that the Act has been contravened in specified respects. The making of such a declaration does not simply record the outcome of enforcement proceedings; it may also be an appropriate way of marking the court's disapproval of the contravening conduct: see Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 80 at 97-99, 106 and 110.",Legal Documents,,,
"Section 1324 permits the Court to grant an injunction ""on such terms as the court thinks appropriate"". These words echo the concluding words of s 80(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (""TPA"") which state that the Court may grant an injunction in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate. These words were introduced into s 80(1) by a 1983 amendment to the TPA, which, to adapt the language used by French J in OD Transport Pty Ltd v WA Government Railways Commission (1987) 13 FCR 500 at 508, freed the power conferred by s 80 from the previous constraint that the injunction granted under it must restrain a person from engaging in conduct that constitutes or would constitute a contravention of Part IV of Part V of the TPA or one of the species of accessorial participation there listed. 67 French J said that s 80 was a widely drawn remedial provision which was available to restrain conduct which may infringe upon the public interest by contravening the provisions of the TPA in Part IV and Part V. His Honour added at 268: ""There is room within the statutory framework and the policy that underlies it for an injunction which is intended not to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct but to deter an offender from repeating the offence. That deterrence is effected by attaching to the repetition of the contravention the range of sanctions available for contempt of court. The possibility remains open, by virtue of s 80(3) , that after a suitable period unmarked by further contravention the party restrained may apply to the court to rescind the order. The remedy is flexible and may be applied in service of a variety of functions to support the policy of the Act . This was a proper case for the grant of that relief.""",Legal Documents,,,
"The operation of s 80(1) of the TPA was canvassed by the Full Court of this Court in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1992) 38 FCR 248 ("" ICI ""). Lockhart J described s 80(1) as a public interest provision which attracts special considerations; it represents a primary means of ensuring compliance with commercial regulation legislation: at 254-255. After referring to subss 80(4) and (5), Lockhart J said: ""Injunctions are traditionally employed to restrain repetition of conduct. A statutory provision that enables an injunction to be granted to prevent the commission of conduct that has never been done before and is not likely to be done again is a statutory enlargement of traditional equitable principles. But this is because traditional doctrine surrounding the grant of injunctive relief was developed primarily for the protection of private proprietary rights. Public interest injunctions are different. Parts IV and V of the Act involve matters of high public policy. Parts IV and V relate to practices and conduct that legislatures throughout the world in different forms and to different degrees, have decided are contrary to the public interest (contracts, arrangements or understandings affecting competition adversely (s 45)), the misuse of market power (s 46) , the practice of exclusive dealing (s 47) , resale price maintenance (s 48) , price discrimination (s 49) , anti-competitive mergers (s 50) and unfair practices with respect to consumers (Pt V). These are legislative enactments of matters vital to the presence of free competition and enterprise and a just society."" In his Honour's view, the section would in an appropriate case authorise the Court to grant an injunction against a respondent preventing him in engaging in conduct which is similar to the conduct which constituted, or would constitute, a contravention of the Act : at 261. Lockhart J also agreed (at 261) with the reasoning of Barwick CJ in Mikasa (NSW) Pty Ltd v Festival Stores [1972] HCA 69 ; (1972) 127 CLR 617 at 632 that in an appropriate case the court may grant an injunction to restrain the respondent from engaging in the practice of resale price maintenance notwithstanding that only some of the acts falling within s 96(3) were found to have been so committed. 68 In ACCC v Z-Tek Computer Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 197 at 202 at [D]-[E], after referring to these passages in ICI , Merkel J said: ""The width of the power conferred by s 80 and its public interest character obviously give the Court great amplitude in determining appropriate injunctive orders in a particular case. However there are limitations on the Court's power under the section. Confinement of the power by reference to the scope and purpose of the TPA, and in particular s 80 , is one limitation on the power. However, there are at least two further limitations. The power to make orders under s 80 is only enlivened in a proceeding which alleges that there has been a contravention of a provision of Pt IV , IVA or V of the TPA. As was said by Gummow J in ICI at 267, the terms of an injunction granted under s 80 must, on their face, operate upon a range of conduct which has 'the relationship required by s 80 with contravention of the Act . Irrespective of whether the injunction is sought or granted under s 80(1) or 80 (1AA) there must be a nexus between the conduct alleged or found to constitute the relevant contraventions and the injunctions granted."" 70 Most recently, in Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2006] FCAFC 21 , a Full Court (comprising Ryan, Finn and Allsop JJ) noted the apparent tension between the view expressed by Lockhart and Gummow JJ in ICI . Their Honours said at [30]-[31]: ""His Honour's reference to terms having 'an operation outside the boundaries of s 80 ' is no more than a paraphrase of the actual words of the subsection 'such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate.' That paraphrase, we consider with respect, does not illuminate the amplitude which should be given, as a matter of construction, to the grant of power. In our view, a more helpful guide to resolving the question of construction is afforded by this observation, also from ICI v Trade Practices Commission , of Lockhart J (with whom French J agreed) at 256; 'In my opinion subss (4) and (5) are designed to ensure that once the condition precedent to the exercise of injunctive relief has been satisfied (ie contraventions or proposed contraventions of Pt IV or V of the Act ), the court should be given the widest possible injunctive powers, devoid of traditional constraints, though the power must be exercised judicially and sensibly.' This approach of Lochkhart J accords with the view often expressed by the High Court that discretions or powers entrusted to Courts should be read liberally for the relevant statutory purpose, without making implications or imposing limitations not found in the express words: Australian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien [2000] HCA 30 ; (2000) 200 CLR 270 at [77] and see generally for the cases Hewlett Packard v GE Capital [2003] FCAFC 256 ; (2003) 203 ALR 51 at [187] .""

Thus, the Full Court preferred the wider view described by Lockhart and French JJ in ICI to the narrower view which the appellant in Foster sought to found upon the judgment of Gummow J. 71 The issue in Foster was whether an injunction that restrained the fourth respondent from being directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in the promotion or conduct of a business of a specified kind for a period of five years went beyond the power conferred by s 80 of the TPA. As the Full Court explained, this turned on the existence of a sufficient nexus between a contravention that enlivened the Court's power under s 80 and the conduct that was restrained by the injunction: ""In our view, the need, suggested by the authorities, for a nexus between the contravention of the Act which the Court has found and the terms of the restraint which it then decides to impose is a specific reflection of Lockhart J's insistence that the power be exercised 'judicially and sensibly'. It goes to the appropriateness of the relief contemplated by the concluding words of s 80(1) , not to the extent of the power to grant it. If the Court considers that a complete prohibition, whether permanently or for a specified period, on a respondent's engaging in a particular field of commercial activity or industry is required to protect the public from conduct of the kind which constituted the contravention, s 80 is wide enough to support such a prohibition as a matter of power. This analysis of s 80 conforms, we consider, with that recently undertaken by Goldberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd (2005) 215 ALR 482 at 504 [110]."" The Full Court held that there was an appropriate nexus, as the evidence and the trial judge's findings at first instance gave rise to a real fear that the fourth respondent would, unless restrained, commit further conduct of the same general kind. In these circumstances, it was appropriate to cast the injunction more widely in order to catch conduct which was similar to the established contravention: at [34] and [38]. 72 In the present case, I consider that the wider form of injunctive relief is appropriate, especially given the evidence that McDougall attempted to resuscitate the Scheme in another form. The evidence demonstrates, in my view, that the defendants are susceptible to repeating their contraventions of the managed investment provisions of the Act . There is, in my opinion, a sufficient nexus between the wider form of injunctive order sought by ASIC in par 5 of the draft orders, and the contraventions of the Act which were established by the evidence in this case. The wider form of injunction is consented to by the defendants. In all the circumstances, I consider that the wider form of injunction is warranted, and that it will serve the public interest. 73 ASIC seeks orders that the Scheme be wound up pursuant to s 601EE(1) of the Act . A number of ancillary orders are sought, including an order appointing the existing Court appointed receivers as joint and several liquidators of the Scheme. The defendants consent to these orders being made. I have made two minor alterations to the form of the draft orders for the winding up of the Scheme. The first alteration, in par 7, identifies Adrian Lawrence Brown and James Henry Stewart as the receivers appointed by order of Merkel J on 25 October 2005. The second alteration clarifies that the receivers referred to in par 9 are the individuals identified in the above par 7 of the orders.",Legal Documents,,,

"Mr Gargan also argued that he had an entitlement to the issue of orders in the nature of mandamus against the Official Trustee. There may be a question in my mind as to whether that kind of right is a right which would vest, or would be property which is capable of vesting, in the Official Trustee. There are decisions of the New South Wales Court of Appeal which indicate that the right to seek mandamus may be a right which vests in the trustee: cf. Daemer v Industrial Commission (NSW) (1988) 12 NSWLR 45 at 54. However, for present purposes, it is not necessary to explore that proposition. On any view, the duties which are capable of being litigated in a mandamus application are duties of a public kind. I do not think that even if the difficulties in s 86 could be overcome by Mr Gargan that the duty thereby created could be described as public duty. Accordingly, I do not think that a case for issue of orders in the nature of mandamus has any prospects of success. 38 It is then necessary to say a little bit about the nature of the applications which are currently before the court. The first is an application pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) . Section 31A of that Act provides: Summary judgment (1) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if: (a) the first party is prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding. (2) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if: (a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding. (3) For the purposes of this section, a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be: (a) hopeless; or (b) bound to fail; for it to have no reasonable prospect of success. (4) This section does not limit any powers that the Court has apart from this section.",Legal Documents,,,

I should note for completeness that at [11] Hely J relied upon what Adams J had said in Gargan v Scott (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 27 October 2003) and I respectfully adopt what Adams J said at [4]. I do not think that the argument based upon s 13 has any substance whatsoever.",Legal Documents,,,

Nothing in Gye v McIntyre [1991] HCA 60 ; (1991) 171 CLR 609 , in my opinion, provides any succour whatsoever to the notion that s 86 imposes affirmative duties. For that reason, I do not think that such a negligence claim, even if articulated, has prospects. In any event, the only real way the claim could currently be formulated would be pursuant to ss 178 and 179 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth).",Legal Documents,,,
"That operation of s 153B was confirmed by Flick J in this Court in Samootin v Wagner [2008] FCA 1066 at [32] and [33]. His Honour applied what had fallen from Carr, Finn and Sundberg JJ in Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2003] FCAFC 315 at [20] : The Court must first consider whether the sequestration order ought not to have been made. If it so finds, then the Court must consider whether, in the exercise of its discretion, the bankruptcy should be annulled: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not to have been made. That is, the Court is entitled to consider not only the case as disclosed at the time when the sequestration order was made, but also those facts now known then to have existed. The Court excludes those facts which have occurred since the order was made. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not have been made: Re Frank; Ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396 ; Stankiewicz v Plata [2000] FCA 1185 at [19] ; Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 23; Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCA 347.

"As to the annulment of the 1994 bankruptcy, this Court has vested in it, by s 27 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), exclusive jurisdiction in bankruptcy. The meaning of that expression has recently been considered by a Full Court of this Court in the decision of Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2008] FCAFC 172. It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine the precise boundaries of the nature of jurisdiction in bankruptcy. It suffices to observe that an application to annul a bankruptcy pursuant to s 153B lies squarely within the heartland of that jurisdiction. 9 Section 153B provides: Annulment by Court (1) If the Court is satisfied that a sequestration order ought not to have been made or, in the case of a debtor's petition, that the petition ought not to have been presented or ought not to have been accepted by the Official Receiver, the Court may make an order annulling the bankruptcy. (2) In the case of a debtor's petition, the order may be made whether or not the bankrupt was insolvent when the petition was presented. 10 It is apparent from a cursory reading of s 153B that there are two elements to it. The first is the satisfaction in the Court of the fact that a sequestration order ought not to have been made. The second is an exercise by the court of a discretionary power if that condition precedent is satisfied.",Legal Documents,,,
"As I understood his submissions, the central proposition was that whilst he accepted he had consented to the making of the sequestration order in 1994, he had done so in circumstances where he was na&iuml;ve about the operation of the legal system. His admission that the sequestration order had been by consent is recorded in the reasons of Kiefel J in Re Gargan; Ex parte Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [1996] FCA 685 (unreported, Kiefel J, 23 August 1996). Those proceedings involved an earlier attempt by Mr Gargan to annul the bankruptcy. 14 Her Honour recited an affidavit (at [21]) which had been filed by Mr Gargan and which recorded the fact that he no longer opposed the making of the sequestration order. I did not understand Mr Gargan to cavil with that in the course of argument but instead, as it were, he sought to admit and avoid. 15 Notwithstanding his, at times, ingenious submissions, I am not persuaded that the circumstances surrounding the making of the sequestration order in 1994 are such that I could now be satisfied that it ought not to have been made. It seems, therefore, that the power under s 153B to annul the 1994 bankruptcy does not arise. 16 Although it is unnecessary in those circumstances to consider the likely disposition of the exercise of the discretionary power thereby conferred if it had arisen, I should say for completeness, even if the power in s 153B had been enlivened, I would not have exercised the discretion in Mr Gargan's favour. This is because first, it is apparent and indeed accepted, that the sequestration order was not ultimately resisted. Whatever else one might say about that, it provides a powerful discretionary reason, 14 years later, not now to undo it. 17 Secondly and, perhaps, related to the first point, is the fact that there has now been an extensive delay of 14 years. Finally, there is, of course, the fact that a prior application has been made to annul this bankruptcy and has failed. In each of those circumstances, it seems to me that even construing the amended application and statement of claim in the most charitable of fashions, it simply could not be the case that a claim, now to be brought by Mr Gargan to annul the first bankruptcy, would have any prospects whatsoever. 42 The first and second respondents apply for indemnity costs orders in relation to the dismissal which I have just ordered. It seems to me that in the exercise of the costs discretion the following matters are pertinent. First, the current proceeding involves attempts to re-litigate a number of matters which Mr Gargan has extensively litigated in the past and unsuccessfully. Secondly, in relation to the annulment application, he has made at least one prior annulment application before Kiefel J and failed. Thirdly, he has sought to articulate an argument based upon s 86 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), which operation has been determined, to his knowledge, in a contrary way by the Full Court in Heinrich . 43 Finally, I take into account as a matter of overall impression, that this proceeding commenced by Mr Gargan, in common with a number of other proceedings commenced by him, involve what appear on their face sometimes to be engaging, if obscure, legal questions. However, those arguments are rarely thought through to their final conclusion, and despite Mr Gargan's protestation of having studied law for two years, seem to indicate a desire more to be involved in the disposition of clever legal arguments in court rather than any focused attention upon what the consequences of his actions might be in relation to the parties against whom he brings his proceedings. 44 I am particularly mindful of the fact that Mr Gargan is an undischarged bankrupt. The provisions of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) are, by and large, directed to preventing the bringing of proceedings of the current kind. Although Mr Gargan articulated various ways in which it might plausibly be thought in some obscure circumstances that the current applications might be brought, I have found that those attempts were wholly unsuccessful and meritless. It seems to me that it is appropriate to mark disapprobation of the bringing of these proceedings by the making of the costs orders sought.

"My own view is that s 21R confers a power to appoint, not a power to make, grant or issue any instrument. Section 21R does not talk in terms of the relevant act (the appointment) being made ""by"" or ""pursuant to"" any form of writing, but confers a power to make a decision to appoint, which incidentally to that decision, is to be in writing: see discussion in Re Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd and Collector of Customs (NSW) (1978) 1 ALD 167 at 172; affirmed by the Full Court in Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd (1979) 24 ALR 307; Barton v Croner Trading Pty Ltd (1984) 3 FCR 95 at 110; and Edenmead Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1984) 4 FCR 348 at 352-353.",Legal Documents,,,
"I should indicate that even if I came to the conclusion that there was a failure to adhere to a requirement of consultation with a local Aboriginal community prior to suspension or removal, I would not consider that such failure would vitiate the decision to remove or suspend. I readily accept that the Act has given express and considerable prominence to the role of the local Aboriginal communities, and that the Act envisages that consultation with such communities be undertaken in defined circumstances. However, I must look at the power here being exercised, which is not one of appointment, but of suspension and removal. Such powers may need to be exercised in a variety of circumstances, without there necessarily being any relevance in seeking the views of local Aboriginal communities, such as for instance if a particular inspector was considered no longer to be a fit and proper person. I do not accept that the input of the local Aboriginal community is of the same significance in circumstances of suspension or removal, or that consultation would be regarded as an essential or mandatory requirement to effect a suspension or removal. If necessary to decide, I would take the view that if there was a requirement of consultation with a local Aboriginal community prior to suspension or removal, breach of that requirement would not lead to the invalidity of such a suspension or removal: see generally Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 388-391; and Bond v WorkCover Corporation (SA) (2005) 93 SASR 315 at 331-336.",Legal Documents,,,
"On this basis, the response of the respondent to the letters of Ms Nicholson-Brown's solicitors was appropriate and adequate. The respondent replied to the complaints of Ms Nicholson-Brown by reference to the policy decision, and did not bring into consideration the specific conduct of Ms Nicholson-Brown as this was not a matter for consideration. It cannot be said, in these circumstances, that the response was inadequate, because on my analysis the matters raised that were not adequately responded to from Ms Nicholson-Brown's point of view, could not have affected the outcome of the decision; see generally Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 79 ALR 267 at 276-277.

In view of the opportunity provided to and availed by each applicant to respond to the respondent after the suspension decision, the decision-making process, including the respondent's response to Ms Nicholson-Brown's solicitors letter, viewed in its entirety and in the circumstances of the implementation of a policy decision, did accord natural justice and procedural fairness.",Legal Documents,,,

"In Minh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 86 FCR 304 at 314, Weinberg J observed that the duty to act fairly may be breached if a party is not given a reasonable opportunity to make relevant submissions, to give evidence and to call witnesses. But his Honour went on to say:- ""At the same time, however, the opportunity to make relevant submissions, to give evidence, and to call witnesses in support which must be afforded will always be qualified by a requirement that the material and arguments sought to be presented must be sufficiently relevant and significant to warrant being received."" 29 The power of the AAT to control the proceeding so as to ensure compliance with these principles is found in s 33(1)(a) of the AAT Act . That subsection provides that the procedure of the AAT is, subject to the AAT Act and the Regulations and any other enactment, within the discretion of the AAT. 30 There were only two real issues in the proceeding before Senior Member Kelly. The first was whether there were documents in the possession of CRS which were the subject of the applicant's request. The second was whether CRS had taken all reasonable steps to search for such documents.

"In Kioa , it was also made clear that an applicant entitled to natural justice is entitled to be told of adverse information obtained by the decision-maker from third parties and which he or she proposes to take into account and to be given the opportunity to respond to that information. Brennan J referred to the obligation and identified its limits in the following passage (at 628-629) (footnotes omitted): 'A person whose interests are likely to be affected by an exercise of power must be given an opportunity to deal with relevant matters adverse to his interests which the repository of the power proposes to take into account in deciding upon its exercise: Kanda v Government of Malay ; Ridge v Baldwin per Lord Morris; De Verteuil v Knaggs . The person whose interests are likely to be affected does not have to be given an opportunity to comment on every adverse piece of information, irrespective of its credibility, relevance or significance. Administrative decision-making is not to be clogged by inquiries into allegations to which the repository of the power would not give credence, or which are not relevant to his decision or which are of little significance to the decision which is to be made. Administrative decisions are not necessarily to be held invalid because the procedures of adversary litigation are not fully observed. As Lord Diplock observed in Bushell v Environment Secretary : ""To 'over-judicialise' the inquiry by insisting on observance of the procedures of a court of justice which professional lawyers alone are competent to operate effectively in the interests of their clients would not be fair."" Nevertheless in the ordinary case where no problem of confidentiality arises an opportunity should be given to deal with adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made. It is not sufficient for the repository of the power to endeavour to shut information of that kind out of his mind and to reach a decision without reference to it. Information of that kind creates a real risk of prejudice, albeit subconscious, and it is unfair to deny a person whose interests are likely to be affected by the decision an opportunity to deal with the information. He will be neither consoled nor assured to be told that the prejudicial information was left out of account. The allegation in par 22 was apparently credible, relevant and damaging. The failure to give Mr Kioa an opportunity to deal with it before making an order that Mr and Mrs. Kioa be deported left a risk of prejudice which ought to have been removed. There was nothing in the circumstances of the case - neither in the administrative framework created by the Act nor in any need for secrecy or speed in making the decision - which would have made it unreasonable to have given Mr and Mrs Kioa that opportunity. The failure to give Mr Kioa that opportunity amounts to a non-observance of the principles of natural justice.' The principle referred to in this passage is well established and, for present purposes, needs no further elaboration (see Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 (' Alphaone ') at 590-591. 100 The principles governing the applicant's third submission are relatively clear, although they can give rise to difficulties in terms of application. Ordinarily, a decision-maker is not required to invite comment from an applicant as to the decision-maker's provisional views or mental processes ( F Hoffman-La Roche and Co AG v Secretary for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 per Lord Diplock at 369). However, a decision-maker may be under an obligation to invite comment from an applicant on an adverse conclusion based on known material if that conclusion is not an obvious and natural conclusion from that material. In Alphaone , the Full Court of this Court (Northrop, Miles and French JJ) put the matter in the following way (at 591-592): 'Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question.' 102 The principle was referred to in passing by Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, ex parte Palme [2003] HCA 56 ; (2003) 216 CLR 212 at 219 [21] - [22] (footnotes omitted): 'Further, it does not readily appear how the principles of procedural fairness could be engaged in the manner contended for by the prosecutor. It may be accepted, as the prosecutor submitted, that his entitlement extended to the rebuttal of, and comment by way of submission upon, adverse material received by the decision-maker from other sources. That stops short of supporting a complaint of the nature essentially involved here of the ""pitch"" or ""balance"" in the statement of relevant considerations in the Submission. Further, as indicated above, there is no substance in any complaint of unfair or prejudicial ""lack of balance"". Reference was made by the prosecutor to the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd . Nothing there said supports any different conclusion to that just expressed. The Full Court's statement of principle was as follow: ""Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness, a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision-maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker. It also extends to require the decision-maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made. The decision-maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material. Subject to these qualifications however, a decision-maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question.""' 103 Alphaone was also referred to in the recent decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63. That case raised a question as to whether the Refugee Review Tribunal had advised, or sufficiently advised, an applicant for review of matters it relied on in dismissing the application. The case turned on the obligation of the Tribunal under s 425 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and the facts of the case. The Court did make some observations about what was said to be a dichotomy between an obligation to advise of adverse conclusions which have been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material, and the lack of an obligation to advise of a decision-maker's mental processes or provisional views. After referring to the passage in Alphaone set out in [100] above, the Court said (at [30], [31] and [32]) (footnotes omitted) : 'Particular attention was directed in argument in this Court, as it had been in the courts below, to the Tribunal's conclusion that the three identified elements of the appellant's story were not ""plausible"". Was that a conclusion ""which would not obviously be open on the known material""? Or was it no more than a part of the ""mental processes"" by which the Tribunal arrived at its decision? Stated in this way, the argument seeks to elucidate the content of the requirements of procedural fairness by setting up a dichotomy. There are two reasons to exercise considerable care in approaching the problem in that way. First, it is far from clear that the two categories that are identified (conclusions not obviously open on the known material, and mental processes of decision-making) encompass all possible kinds of case that may fall for consideration. Secondly, there is a very real risk that focusing upon these two categories will distract attention from the fundamental principles that are engaged. In Alphaone the Full Court rightly said: ""It is a fundamental principle that where the rules of procedural fairness apply to a decision-making process, the party liable to be directly affected by the decision is to be given the opportunity of being heard. That would ordinarily require the party affected to be given the opportunity of ascertaining the relevant issues and to be informed of the nature and content of adverse material."" (emphasis added) The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal. The applicant is to be invited ""to give evidence and present arguments relating to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"". (emphasis added) The reference to ""the issues arising in relation to the decision under review"" is important.' Towards the end of the reasons for judgment, the Court made the following observation (at [49]): 'Finally, even if the issues that arise in relation to the decision under review are properly identified to the applicant, there may yet be cases which would yield to analysis in the terms identified by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Alphaone . It would neither be necessary nor appropriate to now foreclose that possibility.'",Legal Documents,,,
"I am not prepared to infer that the respondent was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest. In the notice of the order dated 23 February 2005 ([7] above) the respondent states that he is satisfied that the acquisition 'is contrary to the national interest'. The minute refers to the provisions of s 21A(4) and to that part of the subsection which refers to the national interest. It is clear that it was a matter which was brought to the respondent's attention. It is true that in terms of the minute the particular matters relevant to the national interest are not clearly identified. Furthermore, the respondent did not give reasons for his decision and he did not give evidence. However, care needs to be exercised in this area because of the broad nature of the concept of the national interest. A court will be slow to interfere with a Minister's decision as to what is in the national interest on the ground that a matter not taken into account was relevant to the national interest or a matter taken into account was irrelevant to the national interest: Leisure Entertainment Pty Ltd v Willis (1996) 64 FCR 205 at 220; Conwest Global Communications Corporation v Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia (1997) 147 ALR 509 at 525.

Allsop J applied this principle in Navarrete v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1723.,Legal Documents,,,
"The applicant submits that the question whether the Treasurer is satisfied that an acquisition is contrary to the national interest is a jurisdictional fact and that it is not made out if the matters the Treasurer took into account do not support a reasonable and rational conclusion to that effect. She referred to the reasons for judgment of Kirby J in Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor (2001) 207 CLR 291, in particular at 504-505 [338]. The reasons of Kirby J do seem to support the submission advanced by the applicant, but I would not apply them in this case. None of the other Justices in Re Patterson; Ex parte Taylor (supra) took a similar approach. For example, Gaudron J, who did discuss the concept of national interest, decided the case on the basis that the Minister asked herself the wrong question (at 417-420 [74]-[82]). If there is a jurisdictional fact in this case it is not whether the acquisition is contrary to the national interest but, rather, whether the Treasurer was satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest. A question of that nature would not turn, ordinarily at least, on the Court's conclusion as to whether the material before the Minister provided a reasonable or rational foundation for the conclusion reached by the Minister. 122 I reject the applicant's submission that the respondent was not in fact satisfied that the acquisition is contrary to the national interest. 123 For these reasons I make the following orders: 1. An order in the nature of certiorari quashing the order made by the respondent on 23 February 2005 under s 21A(4) of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) ('the Act') and relating to the land known as 481 Esplanade, Grange, in the State of South Australia, being the said land comprised in File Plan 42, Allotment 6, Hundred: Yatala; Subdivision: Grange ('the property'). 2.

"In Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 (' Kioa '), Mason J (as he then was) (at 582) referred to the fundamental rule of the common law doctrine of natural justice that, generally speaking, a person is entitled to know the case against him and to be given an opportunity of replying to it. Brennan J (at 612-616) referred to the authorities to the effect that the content of the rules of natural justice will depend on the circumstances of the particular case, including the nature of the jurisdiction or power exercised and the statutory provisions governing its exercise. Brennan J considered whether there was an irreducible minimum required by the principles of natural justice, namely, that 'the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case' ( Russell v Duke of Norfolk [1949] 1 All ER 109 per Lord Tucker at 118). Brennan J said (at 615-616): 'Yet Tucker LJ said in Russell v Duke of Norfolk [179] , that there is an irreducible minimum required by the principles of natural justice, namely, that ""the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case "" . If his Lordship's view be right, it would be necessary to hold that if, in some circumstances, perhaps unusual circumstances, a power may need to be exercised peremptorily, no exercise of that power is conditioned on observance of the principles of natural justice. But it would be wrong to attribute to a legislature such an intention. Rather, the intention to be implied when the statute is silent is that observance of the principles of natural justice conditions the exercise of the power although in some circumstances the content of those principles may be diminished (even to nothingness) to avoid frustrating the purpose for which the power was conferred. Accepting that the content of the principles of natural justice can be reduced to nothingness by the circumstances in which a power is exercised, a presumption that observance of those principles conditions the exercise of the power is not necessarily excluded at least where, in the generality of cases in which the power is to be exercised, those principles would have a substantial content.'",Legal Documents,,,

"A natural person may be a citizen of Australia or a non-citizen. In the case of a natural person who is a citizen, there is no definition in the Act of 'resident' or 'ordinarily'. There are a large number of cases which have examined the meaning of those words in various statutory contexts. It seems that the words are not terms of art and the question is one of fact and degree and that a person may have two places of residence: Re Vassis; Ex parte Leung (1986) 9 FCR 518 at 524-525 per Burchett J; Re Taylor; Ex parte Natwest Australia Bank Limited (1992) 37 FCR 194 at 197 per Lockhart J.

"I also agree with the respondent's second submission that in any event the degree of impairment of the applicant's rights with respect to the property is insufficient to attract the operation of s 51(xxxi).

"Mr Spencer submitted that he had sought on a number of occasions to suggest a reasonable basis upon which this proceeding could be settled, and that the ACCC had acted unreasonably in refusing to engage with him. He referred to Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Limited (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201 where Hill J summarised the principles that would ordinarily apply with regard to costs when a proceeding has not gone to trial. His Honour said: ""These cases seem to me support the following propositions being made. (1) Where neither party desires to proceed with litigation the Court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceedings by making a cost order: Stratford [ J T Stratford &amp; Son Ltd v Lindley (No 2) [1969] 1 WLR 1547] and the SEQEB case [ South East Queensland Electricity Board v Australian Telecommunications Commission (unreported, Federal Court, 10 February 1989, Pincus J)] . (2) It will rarely, if ever, be appropriate, where there has been no trial on the merits or, for a Court determining how the costs of the proceeding should be borne to endeavour to determine the outcome of a hypothetical trial: Stratford . This will particularly be the case where a trial on the merits would involve complex factual matters where credit could be an issue. (3) In determining the question of costs it would be appropriate, however, for the Court to determine whether the applicant acted reasonably in commencing the proceedings and whether the respondent acted reasonably in defending them ( SEQEB ). (4) In a particular case it might be appropriate for the Court in its discretion to consider the conduct of a respondent prior to the commencement of the proceedings where such conduct may have precipitated the litigation: cf Sunday Times Newspaper Co Ltd v McIntosh (1933) 33 SR (NSW) 371. (5) Where the proceedings terminate after interlocutory relief has been granted, the Court may take into account the fact that interlocutory relief has been granted: cf Re Asiatic Electric Co Pty Ltd [1973] 1 NSWLR 603 at 606, a case which, however, depended upon the specific working of the statute under consideration.""",Legal Documents,,,

"The principles are stated by Gummow J in Wanem Pty Ltd v John Tekiela [1990] FCA 372 ; (1990) 19 IPR 435 at 440, cited with approval by the Full Court in Foggin v Lacey (2003) 57 IPR 225 at [13]. Gummow J said: ...(i) first impressions are important in determining whether there is an infringement of a design, (ii) an obvious imitation is one which is not the same as the registered design but is a copy apparent to the eye notwithstanding slight differences, (iii) the question must be looked at as one of substance and by examining the essential features of the design, (iv) a closer correspondence between the registered design and the alleged infringing design is necessary to satisfy the test of obvious imitation than that of fraudulent imitation, (v) precise mathematical comparisons or matters of measurements or ratios, which form no part of the mental picture which the eye conveys to the brain of shape or configuration suggested by the design, are not to be applied as the test of infringement; appearance to the eye is the critical issue, and (vi) questions of infringement must not be determined by a narrow or overly technical approach in comparison between the design and the alleged infringement, lest the registration be sapped of its worth to the registered owner. 116 As the Full Court in Foggin noted, it is for the Court to rule on the meaning of the design and question of infringement as determined by reference to the eye of the consumer. 117 My first, and continuing, impression is that product B is significantly different in appearance from the Design. In particular the shank is quite different. What is in issue here is an everyday product. To the lay person this looks like a saw, obviously not a hand saw but one with some attachment in the shape of the shank. I regard this as more important than differences in angles and proportions. Put simply, the Design shows a saw blade with a shank; product B is a saw with a different sort of shank. 118 As might be expected experts on either side gave differing views. Professor Redmond thought that the dominant aspect of the Design was the blade and that product B was ""closely similar, such that it has the same appeal to the eye as the design in the (Design)"". He saw the shank as an ""attachment device"" but the saw blade was the ""core or crucial visual element"". The shank was ""peripheral"" or ""of less significance"". Nevertheless I think the ordinary consumer would see a panel saw blade as a piece of metal with teeth along the bottom and a sloping top. The shank is at one end, and thus is in a literal sense peripheral, but it is, and would be seen as, an integral and distinctive part of the article.",Legal Documents,,,

"Much of this argument overlapped with GMCA's case on description, utility, novelty and obviousness. To the extent that it did not, it must be rejected.

"It is not in dispute that GMCA has offered for sale and sold in Australia two allegedly infringing products, referred to in this case as T1 and T2.

"However, statutory rights to damages or an account of profits conferred on owners or exclusive licensees of intellectual property only have effect for the period that a plaintiff in fact has the relevant status. Thus in Colbeam Palmer Ltd v Stock Affiliates Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 50 ; (1968) 122 CLR 25 Windeyer J held (at 36) that an account of profits should be taken to terminate as at the date the plaintiff assigned the trade mark in question and (at 41) that the assignee, having been joined as a plaintiff, should be entitled to an account of profits from the date of assignment. Similarly in Stack v Brisbane City Council (1996) 35 IPR 296 at 302 Drummond J held that where an equitable title had been converted into legal title by assignment, the assignor would have the right to an account of profits made by the infringers in the period up to the assignment and that the assignee alone would have the right to any profits made by the infringers after that date. Likewise, if an election were made for damages the assignee is the proper claimant for that relief, but only as from the date its equitable ownership became converted by registration into full legal and beneficial ownership of the patent.",Legal Documents,,,
"ACCC then made the following submissions as to the general principles against which the motion should be determined: (1) The power to make the direction is conferred by s 47A(1) of the Act. That subsection provides: The Court or a Judge may, for the purpose of any proceeding, direct or allow testimony to be given by videolink, audiolink or other appropriate means. (2) Section 47C provides: (1) The Court or a Judge must not exercise the power conferred by subsection 47A(1) or section 47B in relation to a video link unless the Court or the Judge is satisfied that the following conditions are met in relation to the video link: ... (b) the place at which the remote person is located is equipped with facilities (for example, television monitors) that enable all eligible persons present in that place to see and hear each eligible person who is present in the courtroom or other place where the Court or the Judge is sitting; ... (6) For the purposes of the application of this section to a particular proceeding, eligible persons are such persons as the Court or a Judge considers should be treated as eligible persons for the purposes of that proceeding. (Emphasis in original) (3) The discretion in s 47A is to be exercised judicially. (4) It is to be exercised recognising 'that there are deficiencies when evidence is taken by videolink when compared with evidence given viva voce' per Spender J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v World Netsafe (No. 1) [2002] FCA 526 ; (2002) 119 FCR 303 at 305. His Honour continued by quoting from Giles CJ of the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in Sunstate Airlines (Qld) Pty Ltd v First Chicago Australia Securities Ltd (unreported, NSWSC, 11 March 1997) at [4]: Cross-examination may be more difficult when video evidence is taken because documents have to be transmitted or produced in an unfamiliar manner, because of the delay in voice transmission, or for other reasons and the effectiveness of cross-examination as a weapon in the fight for truth should not be unduly hindered. And in many cases the court is assisted in fact by observance of what is misleadingly called the demeanour of the witnesses upon which the taking of video evidence may impact. Those observations of Spender J were cited with approval by a Full Court of this Court in Odhiambo v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 194 ; (2002) 122 FCR 29 at [97] . I agree with these observations. They illustrate the point that the choice in every case cannot be determined solely by reference to general principles because it is the application of those principles to the facts and circumstances of the particular case which must determine the choice; in the circumstances of a particular case, a matter may point one way and in another case it may point another way. At the end of the day, the exercise of the discretion as to what is appropriate in a particular case will involve a balancing exercise as to what will best serve the administration of justice consistently with maintaining justice between the parties: see Giles CJ in Sunstate Airlines at [4]. The Present Case In the present case, I have come to the conclusion that I should decline to make the direction for the following primary reasons: (1) There is no evidence before me that the Cooling Off Witnesses are not prepared to come to Sydney for the hearing or, through illness or otherwise, are unable to come. I accept that they are not compellable, but 9 of the 12 are still employees of StoresOnline and as StoresOnline will be bearing the cost of all travel and accommodation for all Cooling Off Witnesses, there is no financial disincentive for them in coming. References to their losing commission income while travelling and during their short stay here carries little weight, if any, particularly as it could no doubt be adjusted in their favour, by StoresOnline treating it as a 'one week off', in the 'two weeks on'/'one week off' arrangement for Sales Staff deposed to by Mr Klotz. (2) In my view, the overall savings in cost, by taking the evidence of the Cooling Off Witnesses by video-link rather than having them come here to give their evidence viva voce , will be at best marginal and at worst more expensive. The savings deposed to by Mr Klotz are, in the scheme of things, not significant and do not take into account all the costs associated with and all the costs which will arise as a result of, recourse to a video-link. It will, as submitted by the ACCC, require the ACCC to have an agent or agents at the remote location or locations to assist in the identification of documents during the course of cross-examination; it will undoubtedly lengthen the time it takes to complete the cross-examination of the Cooling Off Witnesses each day will at best be a half day due to time zone differences with attendant increase in the costs incurred for the additional time of counsel and instructing solicitors; and it would be common ground that these latter costs would quickly absorb and overtake any savings as between travel and accommodation costs on the one hand and the direct cost of utilising videoconference facilities on the other. (3) Clearly there are issues of credit involved as between the evidence in chief embodied in the affidavits of the Cooling Off Witnesses and the evidence in chief embodied in the affidavits of the ACCC's witnesses who purchased StoresOnline packages at the relevant Workshops in Australia going to the factual issue of whether or not the purchasers of such packages were told, at any time up to and including the point of sale, about the 'cooling off period'. In my view, it is in the interests of maintenance of justice between the parties that that evidence, from both sides, be given in person. (4) It is also clear that the cross-examination of the Cooling Off Witnesses will go beyond their evidence in relation to the 'cooling off period' issue. They will also be cross-examined in relation to other allegations of breaches contained in the statement of claim, as well as on the systems and procedures in place with a view to ensuring compliance with the Undertaking. So understood, their evidence is, contrary to the submission of StoresOnline, centrally important to the outcome of the case. (5) The anticipated size of the Court Book suggests that the Cooling Off Witnesses will be taken to a large number of documents in the course of their cross-examination. I accept that the management of such a task can be effectively handled whilst utilising videoconference facilities albeit, as mentioned above, at an additional significant cost. At one level then, this consideration is central. But where, as here, issues of credit are involved, it impels a conclusion in favour of the evidence being given in person. There are other matters which I have weighed into the balancing exercise in reaching the conclusion I have, in addition to the primary matters referred to in [15] above. On their own, they are not critical. However, as part of the balancing exercise they are, in my view, relevant; for example, the Cooling Off Witnesses are all people who regularly travel, both domestically and internationally, for or on behalf of StoresOnline. While having them travel from the United States to Australia and return will involve them in some 15 hours of travel each way within a relatively short timeframe, this is something to which they are accustomed in the course of their duties. It could not be seen as imposing on them an unusual personal or physical burden. The motion must be dismissed with costs.

"No stay is sought if the first and third applicants fail to provide the security. Rather, if I were to order that security be provided, the applicants contend that the notice of motion should be adjourned to the day after the security is required to be provided, or later in the day upon which the security is required to allow the respondents to make further submissions regarding any further orders, which may be appropriate if that security is not provided. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPLICANTS 8 In response, Mr Perry on behalf of the applicants has submitted, in essence: 1. Neither the first nor the third applicant has sufficient assets to meet any potential costs order, nor are they able to satisfy any order for security for costs. Accordingly the threshold for the making of an order has been established consistently with the decision of the Full Court in these proceedings. 2. However the question before the Court is whether the Court should exercise its discretion in this matter, and the key issue in relation to the exercise of discretion is the delay in serving the notice of motion for the security for costs on the applicants. In particular: (a) the notice was served on Friday 3 November 2006, and no notice had been given previously as to an intention to bring such an application (b) the impact of the delay is to be considered in a relative way, that is by considering its potential impact upon the hearing itself (c) if an order is to be made it cannot be satisfied by 4.00 pm Friday 10 November 2006 (d) notwithstanding that the motion does not seek a stay, it would be an extraordinary result for security to be ordered without there being some consequence attached to a failure to provide it (e) if a more realistic timeframe is given for the provision of security, the trial ought not to commence until the expiry of that time. SECURITY FOR COSTS 9 The Court has discretion under s 56 of Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to order an applicant to a proceeding to give security for costs, and, if security or further security is not given in accordance with an order under this section, the Court may order that the proceeding be dismissed (s 56(4)). As pointed out by the Full Court in Bell Wholesale Co Pty Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 the discretion to make orders under s 56 must be exercised judicially, but that is the only relevant limitation (at 3). Although O 28 r 3 sets out matters the Court may take into account in considering an application for security for costs, this is not an exhaustive statement of the cases in which an order for security for costs can be made ( Bell Wholesale at 3). THE CASE BEFORE ME 10 In my view in the case before me, relevant factors to take into consideration are as follows: 1. The fact that the Full Court on 1 June 2006 has previously ordered the applicants to pay security for costs in this matter, following broad agreement that the amount of $150 000 would be appropriate security for the costs of the respondent parties to the primary proceeding at the end of the first day of the trial ( Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93 at [5] ). 2. I note the submissions of Mr McQuade that there is no evidence that the security would frustrate the litigation or that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means. In Bell Wholesale , the Full Court emphasised that it is for the party against whom security is sought to show the impecuniosity of those who stand behind the company or who will benefit from litigation. Although Mr Perry submitted that it would not be possible for the second applicant, who presumably will be funding the security for costs, to satisfy an order by tomorrow afternoon, there is no indication that the second applicant is impecunious or would be unable at all to satisfy an order by a later date. However: 3. The amount sought by way of security is substantial, namely $87 832, which, if I make the orders sought by the respondents, would need to be paid by tomorrow afternoon. This is a substantial sum to be raised and paid on such short notice. 4. The notice of motion has been filed in extreme proximity to the commencement of the trial without explanation. Indeed, the notice of motion was filed last Friday, mentioned on Monday and heard today in respect of an application for security for costs to be paid by tomorrow before a trial commences on Monday next. The fact that I can make reference to these days without dates illustrates the extreme tightness of the timing in the case before me. I note a similar matter which came before Toohey J in James v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1985) 9 FCR 442 when an application for security for costs was made one month before the commencement of the trial. His Honour said in that case: 'It is well established that an application for security for costs should be made promptly... The matter is now so close to a hearing and so much time and costs have been expended that it would be a grave injustice to the applicants if they were ordered to provide security for costs when it is apparent that they cannot comply with such an order.' (at 446) 5. The November trial date of this matter has been known by all parties since late July 2006. At the directions hearing of 28 July 2006 I indicated to the parties the importance of compliance with Court directions in this matter and the need to be prepared for trial in November. As pointed out recently by Jessup J in Acohs Pty L Ltd v Ucorp Pty Ltd &amp; Ors [2006] FCA 1279 at [61] - [63] , citing authorities including Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 308, it is an accepted principle in the ordering of security for costs that such an application should be made promptly. Although I know that the respondents did not file an application for security for costs until after it was clear that a mediated settlement of this matter would not take place, the success or otherwise of the mediation would not have prevented the respondents applying at an earlier date for security for costs of the trial, particularly if payment was sought to be made after the date by which medication was ordered to take place. While I note that the respondents had earlier sought and obtained an order for security for pre-trial costs, no satisfactory explanation has been provided as to why an application for security for trial costs has been brought on what is, in effect, the eve of the trial. 6. There have already been other significant delays in this matter in such respects as the hearing of the trial itself (adjourned from July 2006 to November 2006) and mediation of the matter (orders for which were made on 9 August 2006 for the mediation to take place by no later than 20 October 2006, but which did not occur until 2 November 2006). Obviously, as pointed out by the High Court in State of Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146, issues of case management do not take precedence over issues of justice. However, the fact that this case has already been characterised by significant delays is undesirable from the perspective of the parties and the Court, and there is an obvious risk that an order for security for costs which proves unrealistic for the applicants to comply with would delay the trial even further. 7. The respondents have sought no consequences as part of an order such as a stay in the event that security for costs are not paid before the commencement of the trial. As observed by Toohey J in James : 'Despite the submission of counsel for the first respondent, an order by way of security without a corresponding stay would be, in reality, no order at all, for no sanction would attach to non-compliance.' (at 446) 8. Although I said earlier in this judgment there is no evidence that the security would frustrate the litigation or that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means, in cases where similar submissions have been successful (for example in Checked-Out Pty Ltd v Eagle Eye Inspections Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1475 at [26] ) there were also no clear issues of delay or proximity to the hearing date as there are in this case. The issue here is not that there is a suggestion of impecuniosity of the second applicant, it is whether the delay in bringing the application for security for costs and the proximity of this application to the trial date militate against the exercise of my discretion to grant an order for security for costs in this case. 11 In my view, notwithstanding that the applicants have been ordered at an earlier date to pay security for pre-trial costs, the delays and the proximity to the hearing date of this application for trial costs in my view weigh against the exercise of a discretion in favour of the respondents in relation to this notice of motion.",Legal Documents,,,
"The current position is that the Full Court on Thursday 1 June 2006 ordered that the first and third applicant provide security for the costs of the first and second respondent of the proceeding up to the end of the first day of the trial in the amount of $150 000 by way of unconditional bank guarantee in that sum or otherwise to the satisfaction of the District Registrar of the Queensland District Registry of the Court: Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd v Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 93. I understand that security for costs was provided on Thursday 22 June 2006. 6 For the purposes of this judgment, I shall assume that the costs order of the Full Court was exhausted on Monday 17 July 2006 which was the first day of the trial, subsequently adjourned. 7 In his written submissions supplemented by oral submissions this morning in Court, Mr McQuade for the respondents submitted in summary as follows: 1. The sum sought by way of security for costs is referrable to the estimate of Mr James McLellan in his affidavit sworn 23 March 2006 and filed 27 March 2006. 2. Otherwise, the respondents rely on submissions and material previously before this Court and the Full Court. 3. The financial position of the first and third applicants is unchanged from April 2006. 4. There is no evidence that security would frustrate litigation and no evidence that those who stand behind the companies and who stand to benefit from litigation are also without means. 5. The onus is on the first and second applicants to raise impecuniosity of those whom litigation would benefit and to prove the facts upon which a contention is founded. 6. The trial will take two weeks. The parties are proposing to call 15 witnesses. 7. The respondents have not adduced any evidence that would weigh against an order for security. 8. There is evidence that the second applicant had an expectation of obtaining further funds to provide by way of security for costs. 9. There has been no delay by the respondents as to the notice of motion for security for costs. It was filed the day following an unsuccessful mediation between the parties. 11. No stay is sought if the first and third applicants fail to provide the security. Rather, if I were to order that security be provided, the applicants contend that the notice of motion should be adjourned to the day after the security is required to be provided, or later in the day upon which the security is required to allow the respondents to make further submissions regarding any further orders, which may be appropriate if that security is not provided.

"First, in my opinion, to relitigate the events of 27 March 2006 is an abuse of process and the pursuit of the claim for unlawful discrimination would involve a relitigation of the events of 27 March 2006. The Court has a wide jurisdiction to protect a party from an abuse of process constituted by an attempt to relitigate a case already disposed of: Walton v Gardiner [1993] HCA 77 ; (1993) 177 CLR 378 at 392-393 per Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ. It seems clear on the authorities that a proceeding may constitute an abuse of process because it involves an attempt to relitigate a dispute already judicially determined even though none of the doctrines of res judicata , issue estoppel in the strict sense or an Anshun estoppel are made out: Coffey v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1999] FCA 375 ; (1999) 86 FCR 434 at 443 [25] ; Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd (No 6) [2004] FCA 1699 at [58] - [70] per French J; SZAJB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008) 168 FCR 410 at 423 [37]-[39] per French J (with whom Tracey J agreed at 437 [114]); Brock v Minister for Home Affairs (2008) 170 FCR 434 at 447 [74] per Lindgren and Tracey JJ. The claim for unlawful discrimination represents an attempt to relitigate the events of 27 March 2006 and is an abuse of process. I am mindful of the fact that, as events transpired, the claim for unlawful discrimination could not have been brought in the earlier proceeding, but that does not dissuade me from reaching the conclusion that I have expressed. The fact is that it was the applicant who decided to institute the earlier proceeding the day after the relevant events, to lodge his complaint with the Commission about three weeks after the relevant events, and to wait until 14 July 2006 before advising the Court that he had lodged a complaint with the Commission.",Legal Documents,,,
"An alternative ground for the conclusion that I should not disqualify myself from hearing the present application on the ground of apparent bias is this. The test for apparent bias is well-known and it is ""whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide"": Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 492 [11] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. In this case, if there is apparent bias, it takes the form of prejudgment. That form of bias was considered by the High Court in Livesey v The New South Wales Bar Association [1983] HCA 17 ; (1983) 151 CLR 288. In assessing that form of apparent bias in this case, the nature of the respondents' application is important. The respondents' application is not one in which I was called upon to make findings as to credit or, indeed, to make any findings of fact. The applicant's allegations of fact may be accepted for the purposes of the respondents' application. The questions raised by the respondents' application are, in substance, questions of law, and, having regard to all the circumstances, I do not think it can be said that a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that I might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the question I am required to decide: Sydney Refractive Surgery Centre Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (2007) 68 ATR 19 ; Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Taylor [2008] VSC 3.",Legal Documents,,,
"The applicant lodged an appeal against the order I made dismissing the proceeding but, on 4 December 2007, the Full Court of this Court dismissed the appeal and ordered that the appellant in the appeal pay the respondent's costs thereof: Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCAFC 188. 12 The applicant then applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal against the orders made by the Full Court but, on 15 May 2008, that application was dismissed. 13 One other point to note about the earlier proceeding is this. Before the present proceeding was instituted, the applicant made a complaint about the respondent's conduct to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (""the Commission"") (as it then was). In the course of a directions hearing in the earlier proceeding held on 14 July 2006, I fixed 17 and 18 August 2006 for the trial of the earlier proceeding. Those dates were subsequently vacated and, as I have said, the proceeding was heard on 5 and 6 October 2006. The point to be made is that at the directions hearing held on 14 July 2006, the applicant said that he had a complaint of ""disability discrimination on the same fact by the University"". He said that the complaint had been lodged with the Commission. He said that the first respondent had asked for an extension of time to respond. The applicant raised the possibility of the proceeding then before the Court (that is, the earlier proceeding) being delayed so that it could be dealt with at the same time as any proceeding following the applicant's complaint to the Commission. In response, counsel for the first respondent said: Your Honour, we sought an extension of time from the Human Rights Commission. Perhaps we ought more properly have explained to them that these proceedings were on foot because, as I understand it, that would forestall the progression of any complaint stage in the Commission, and that is their policy, that is my understanding of their policy. The matter is only at the complaint stage; no proceedings have been issued. ... ... as I understand it the complaint stage needs to be worked through the Commission and examined by the Commissioner before formal proceedings are able to be initiated. We have undertaken mediation unsuccessfully. I think that the parties are some great difference apart in terms of the legal basis of the claim, but the mediation did crystallise some of the issues and we would seek that the matter be brought to trial as expeditiously as possible because we see that the trial is the only way to resolve those matters.",Legal Documents,,,
"The trial of the earlier proceeding was held on 5 and 6 October 2006. On 31 May 2007, I made an order that the proceeding be dismissed and I delivered reasons for judgment: Rana v University of South Australia [2007] FCA 816. I will refer to those reasons as the earlier judgment. 9 One point to note, and the relevance of this will become apparent, is that in the course of the earlier judgment I said (at [4]) that I found the applicant ""a most unsatisfactory witness"" and that I did not accept his evidence except where it accorded with other evidence which I accepted. I said that the applicant's evidence as to important events changed during the course of the proceeding, that some of his evidence was highly improbable and a good deal of his evidence was inconsistent with evidence which I accepted.",Legal Documents,,,
"On 19 June 2007, I made an order that the applicant pay the respondent's costs of the proceeding on an indemnity basis: Rana v University of South Australia (No 2) [2007] FCA 941. I said the following (at [6]): In my opinion, this is an appropriate case for the award of indemnity costs. Mr Rana made allegations about payment for the tickets and what occurred at the Convention Centre which were critical to his case and he must have known were untrue. Those allegations should not have been made. He claimed that he had suffered loss and damage of $1 million but he proved no loss or damage. He altered a document, namely, a receipt, so that his case would appear stronger. These circumstances alone justify an award of indemnity costs. A further and probably independent reason for awarding indemnity costs is that he refused an offer of $400 in relation to a claim which I dismissed. In all the circumstances, it is appropriate to order that costs be paid on an indemnity basis.",Legal Documents,,,

"The appellant filed on 2 March 2004 an application in the Federal Magistrates Court for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision. The appellant filed an amended application on 19 October 2004 which raised various grounds of review. The appellant claimed that the Tribunal overlooked some critical points of her case and did not address all the relevant issues she had raised, including whether she was considered a 'traitor' because of the anti-governmental views of her family. The appellant also claimed the Tribunal: failed to ask relevant questions, failed to determine whether the appellant was subject to persecution because of her imputed political opinion, failed to determine the 'particular social group' the applicant belonged to, and failed to enquire as to whether the appellant's past or future conduct would amount to persecution. The appellant also referred the Court below to the decision of SZARH v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FMCA 615 , which was said by the appellant to raise similar issues to her proceedings currently before the Court. 10 The appellant's application below was heard on 22 May 2006, and a further submission was filed on 2 June 2006. Although the appellant did not seek leave to raise that further submission, the Federal Magistrate decided to consider the matters the subject thereof. That submission dealt in substance with the implications of the filing out of time of her application for review, and referred the Court below to judicial precedents purportedly supportive of the appellant's claims in that regard. 11 The Federal Magistrate was satisfied the appellant had established a reasonable excuse for the delay in bringing the application for review. In considering the appellant's substantive claims, the Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal did consider the aspects of the appellant's claims and that there was no evidence that any claim to the effect that the appellant was a 'traitor' was ever made to the Tribunal. The Federal Magistrate considered the appellant's contention that the Tribunal did not properly consider her claim to be a member of a particular social group. His Honour found this ground could not rightly stand, pointing out at [31] as follows: ""It is well established that a social group cannot be constituted by victims of crime, let alone potential victims of crime, which appears to be the applicant's claim. In any event, the nature of the particular social group claimed by the applicant in the submission was not put to the Tribunal, on the evidence before me"". 12 In line however with what I have observed at [8] above, the Federal Magistrate found the Tribunal did adequately address the issue of effectiveness of state protection in the Ukraine of persons such as the appellant. In relation to the authorities cited by the appellant, his Honour distinguished the same on the facts. The Federal Magistrate found that no case for jurisdictional error was made out and dismissed the application. 13 The Federal Magistrate was also of the opinion that there existed strong compassionate reasons based upon and referrable to humanitarian grounds, which relate largely to the circumstances of the appellant's age, single status and family circumstances. 14 The notice of appeal filed in the Federal Court raised the following grounds: that the Tribunal failed to assess the appellant's 'claims against proper information' and that the Federal Magistrate and the Tribunal misunderstood the appellant's particular social group. 15 The appellant, by way of submissions dated 10 November 2006, submitted that the Tribunal assessed her claims against 'all women advanced in years and living alone in Ukraine'. The appellant contended that the Tribunal should have particularised her social group as 'aged, single women who had relatives overseas, who travelled overseas and who are considered as the ones who had money'. The appellant further submitted that had the Tribunal assessed her claims against that second particular social group, 'it would have no difficulty to accept that [her] claims are Convention-related because there would have been a great deal of independent information consistent with my claims'.",Legal Documents,,,
"application relates to a purported appeal from a decision of Mansfield J delivered on 21 December 2005 ( Dunstan v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (No 2) [2005] FCA 1885).

I indicated to Mr Dunstan on that occasion that the notice of appeal simply did not comply with the Rules of Court in relation to the form and substance of such a document, and explained that it was fundamental that there be a notice of appeal in proper form. I then adverted to the fact that legal advice in a situation of this kind is very helpful, if not essential. I also mentioned the possibility of some pro bono assistance. I have given some consideration to that again but I do not think that it is appropriate to take any steps in relation to that. This is a very particular case which Mr Dunstan presented himself before the trial judge, and to bring anybody in to deal with this on a pro bono basis is, I think on reflection, not likely to be helpful.",Legal Documents,,,
"This is an appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court which dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal affirming a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse the appellant a protection visa. The nature of the appellant's protection visa application, the reasons of the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrate are set out in more detail in the Federal Magistrate's decision, SZJXC v the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2006] FMCA 545 , which is available on the internet. 2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China and his claim to be a refugee rests on an alleged fear of persecution based on his involvement in the practice of Falun Gong. 3 In his protection visa application he claimed to have been a member of Falun Gong since 1999. He said that after Falun Gong was banned by the authorities he would transport members for meetings and gatherings and provide emergency transportation. He claimed that in March 2005 while assisting the leader to escape from detention he was caught by police and held and interrogated for eight days and suffered ""serious mental and physical torment"". He claimed to have been forced to attend re-education classes and be supervised by what was called the 610 office.

"While the evidence in the matter is that the Tribunal member who issued the listening device warrant was named in an AFP statement of facts given to the applicant in August 2008, it has not been suggested that he was aware at the time of the Tribunal hearing that the member hearing the review application was the person who issued the warrant. Neither did the Tribunal member disclose that fact if he was then actually aware of it.

"The authorities most immediately relevant in a factual setting such as the present on the applicant's contentions are R v Eastman (1994) 121 FLR 150 and R v George (1987) 9 NSWLR 527. In each case, at some time prior to the criminal proceedings in question, the judge who respectively became the trial judge authorised the use of a listening device in relation to the person who was ( Eastman ), or subsequently became ( George ), the accused in the proceedings. In George the particular matter before the judge under the Listening Devices Act did not involve anything to do with the subject of the later charges. In Eastman the contrary was the case and, when the matter was drawn to his attention, the trial judge disqualified himself on the ground of reasonable apprehension of bias. As he said (at 153): What distinguishes this application from the application made in R v George is that the warrants were issued by me on the application of one or more police officers so as to facilitate the acquisition of evidence against the accused. In two instances the exercises were successful, because the Crown proposes to lead evidence of having installed listening devices under the authority of two warrants and the evidence thereby obtained. The ground for disqualifying myself is much stronger than that confronted by the trial judge in R v George . In George in contrast, an appeal challenging a conviction of the ground of apprehended bias was dismissed, the Court having regard to the nature of a criminal trial, the various activities in which judges may be involved in the administration of criminal justice and particularly ""to the absence of any association [of the listening device matter] with this particular case. (ii) Procedural Fairness 41 The applicant's case in its initial form and prior to its being brought within the shadow of Eastman , was founded upon the four ""elements"" propounded by Hayne J in Jia Legeng I have set out above. Put in terms of those elements, it was contended that, first the Senior Member had on 30 May 2009 formed an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the Tribunal; ie that the applicant had committed, or was suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed, a criminal offence on 1 May 2008. This was relevant to the issue of whether the applicant did not pass the character test. It was also relevant in addition by reason of para 1.10 of Direction No 21, as unresolved criminal charges as ""general conduct"", which the Tribunal was required to take into account under para 2.10 when considering whether it was likely to be repeated. Secondly , despite his protestations to the contrary, it is inconceivable that the Tribunal did not take such credible, relevant and significant material into account when it found that there was an unacceptable risk that the applicant would reoffend: cf Applicant VEAL of 2002 at [17]. Thirdly , it is apparent from the way in which the case was conducted that the Tribunal did not give this issue any fresh consideration in the light of whatever may have been the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. To the contrary, the Tribunal member resisted receiving any further evidence from the applicant relating to the matter, thereby leaving the state of the evidence at the time of its decision being that presented to it by the AFP on 30 May 2008. Finally , it is contended that the Tribunal was required to consider the unresolved criminal charges as part of its overall consideration of whether his so-called general conduct was likely to be repeated. This much is apparent from Direction 21. 43 In light of what was said by Gallop J in Eastman , the applicant contends as well that, having made a decision to issue a warrant which required him to form a view of the applicant's recent charge, the Tribunal member ought to have disqualified himself from hearing the subsequent application which required him to form a view of the applicant's conduct and whether he was likely to re-offend. 44 For my own part, I again emphasise that the test to be applied does not require analysis of the likely or actual thought processes of the Tribunal. There is no evidence as to whether, if at all prior to his decision the member recalled issuing the warrant involving Mr Islam. Such view as the lay observer might take on that matter, provided it is reasonable, may well be mistaken. That is not to the point. 45 The Tribunal did not disclose at the hearing its participation in the issue of the warrant. The member may well have had no memory of that. The member, equally, may have known or have become aware of that participation but have considered he could or should neutralise the significance of it by determining the matter without taking into account ""in any way"" the 1 May 2008 allegations. Alternatively and despite the significance to be attributed to ""general conduct"" at the stage of exercising the s 501(1) discretion (which could include ""unresolved charges pending a hearing"": Direction No 21, the member may have been of the view that account ought not be taken of the 1 May charge in any event as the applicant had not been convicted as charged. I express no view on any of these speculations other than to say that they would be contingencies which a fair minded lay observer could reasonably canvas in forming his or her judgment of the matter. 51 As with the Eastman case, I regard the circumstances of this matter as distinctive. While they may be able to be pigeon holed within the four ""elements"" referred to by Hayne J in Jia Legeng as the applicant first contended, that process does not sufficiently accentuate what in my view are the essential concerns which the unusual course of conduct followed in this matter exposes. These are to maintain the integrity of the Tribunal's processes and procedures and to provide public reassurance of that integrity. 52 As Eastman illustrates, the potential is there for apparent compromise of an official's decision making whenever a close relationship or association exists between the subject matter of an administrative or judicial decision to be taken by that official, and adverse information obtained (or an adverse opinion formed) relating to that subject matter in the course of, or as a result of, a separate earlier decision taken by the same official for other purposes. Where it might reasonably be said that the having of (or having had) that information or opinion by virtue of a prior official decision might compromise the proper and impartial taking of the later decision, the same official ought not participate in the later decision. To do so would involve the member in the discharge, in the circumstances, of incompatible functions. Such was the case here. 53 It was inappropriate for the Tribunal member, having determined to authorise the issue of the warrant in relation to Mr Islam, to have then made the s 501(1) refusal determination given the association in subject matter of the two determinations or at least to have done so without the informed waiver of objection by Mr Islam to his so doing. Absent such waiver, I am satisfied that the ""double might"" test of the fair minded lay observer would inevitably be satisfied. 54 I have emphasised the complex of competing possible views, that the conduct of the Tribunal member, the course of the hearing and the Tribunal's decision, could reasonably engender in the lay observer. In my view, despite the Tribunal's and, for that matter, the Minister's disclaimers, such an observer could reasonably entertain an apprehension that the Tribunal's decision might have suffered from prejudgment. The closely associated decision-making that occurred here ought not be countenanced. The Tribunal should have procedures to guard against such a possibility.",Legal Documents,,,

"is one thing; whether or not it is appropriate to exercise it is another. There is no right to declaratory relief. In Platypus Leasing Inc v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) (2005) 189 FLR 411 Gzell J of the New South Wales Supreme Court referred (at [81]) to the undesirability of the use of declaratory relief as a ""staging post"" in litigation. In refusing, as a matter of discretion, to grant declaratory relief in respect of a goods and services tax controversy not yet the subject of an assessment his Honour referred with approval to the following observation made by Young J in McKeown v Cavalier Yachts Pty Ltd (1988) 13 NSWLR 303 at 312: The plaintiff's summons asks for a declaration that the yacht is the property of the plaintiff. I do not believe that such a declaration should be made. Declarations should not be made as a staging post in litigation, and in a case where some executive orders have to be made, it is usually best to proceed to consider those executive orders rather than making declarations. I share the diffidence of Young J and Gzell J in relation to the use of declaratory relief as a ""staging post"". On behalf of Santos and Delhi Petroleum it was submitted that the declarations sought by the Applicants in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Amended Application were staging posts to the end of an assertion in the future of a right to negotiate. I agree that this is, in any event, the true way of conceiving the declarations sought. Therefore, even if for that reason alone, I should not be disposed, as a matter of discretion, to grant that relief. Outcome Given the conclusions which I have reached, the appropriate course to take in the circumstances is to dismiss the application. The alternative suggested, striking out of the amended statement of claim, is not appropriate. The only way to address the fundamental jurisdictional difficulty presently attending the application would be to plead a claim for native title. That would be pregnant with a potential for embarrassment derived from different findings given that the Applicants already claim a native title determination in respect of the claim land in other proceedings in the Court. Further, I have in any event concluded that it is not appropriate, as a matter of discretion, to grant the declaratory relief sought. For these reasons, I should not be disposed to allow any such amendment.

"this case there is evidence that the respondent has sold or attempted to sell Super Bubble to third parties. 24 Prima facie , it appears that the respondent has infringed the applicant's patent. In my view, there is a serious question to be tried. Irreparable harm In both written and oral submissions, the applicant has asserted: 1. The applicant commercially exploits the patent by producing an insulation product known as 'Glareshield'. According to the affidavit of Mr Nicholas Martinovich, the National Sales Manager for the applicant, filed 28 June 2006, Glareshield is by far the single biggest selling product of the applicant, accounting for approximately 85 per cent of the total insulation product sales of the applicant in Australia. 2. Already two of its shed customers, Action Garages and another entity identified as Coastal Garages, are no longer purchasing Glareshield from the applicant's New South Wales distributor, however these customers continue in business. The applicant believes that at least one of these former customers is purchasing Super Bubble from the respondent. 3. The applicant's New South Wales licensee has suffered losses in excess of $30 000 for the period March to May 2006, which losses are also affecting the business of the applicant. 4. The threat to the loss of sales of Glareshield may result in a diminished ability of the applicant to undertake research and development which would place the ongoing viability of the applicant at risk. From the evidence presented this morning it is likely that damages in this case would be an inadequate remedy should the applicant be successful at trial. Alleged 'poaching' of customers by the respondent, the importance of the Glareshield product to the applicant's business, and goodwill associated with the product indicate that irreparable harm is a possible consequence of continuation of the respondent's activities. I also note the submission of the applicant that the respondent appears to have a paid-up capital of $10, rendering a damages award potentially worthless. Balance of convenience Through the affidavit of Mr Scott Gibson, the managing director of the applicant, filed 28 June 2006, the applicant has offered an undertaking as to damages in the event of success in obtaining interlocutory relief. In view of this undertaking, in addition to the harm the applicant says that it is experiencing from the respondent's conduct and the fact that there is a serious question to be tried, the relief sought by the applicant is appropriate. COSTS The applicant has made a number of submissions to me in relation to costs in this matter. In essence the applicant seeks costs on an indemnity basis, or, alternatively, an order under Federal Court Rules O 62 r 3, that costs be taxed and paid forthwith. Indemnity costs In oral and written submissions Mr Logan for the applicant relied on two points in support of an order for indemnity costs. First, the applicant relied on what it describes as a pattern of deliberate and calculated conduct in cynical and flagrant disregard of the applicant's intellectual property rights which has resulted in the need to appear before me today. Counsel cited Masha Nominees v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd [2006] VSC 56 as authority that pre-litigation conduct may be considered in the context of determining whether the circumstances as a whole warrant the making of an indemnity costs order. Second, citing Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225, the applicant states that where an applicant has commenced a proceeding in circumstances where, properly advised, it should have known that there was no chance of success then that is a circumstance which would justify an indemnity costs order. Counsel for the applicant submits that, by analogy to a respondent , such order would be justified where there is no defence asserted, but the respondent continues its conduct so as to put the applicant in a position where it can do nothing other than commence proceedings and incur substantial expense in mounting an interlocutory relief application, where, in effect, properly advised it ought always to have known that there was no answer to the application. Whilst I note the applicant's submissions in relation to indemnity costs I am not persuaded at this stage that this is a case in which there are special or unusual features such as to justify the Court departing from the ordinary practice. Whilst I accept that there is a serious question to be tried and that an interlocutory injunction should be granted I am not of the view that, in the absence of submissions from the respondent, I can be certain that the respondent has no defence and is acting in such a way as having its only purpose ensuring the applicant incurs substantial expense. I note that the respondent currently has different legal representatives to those which were retained when the applicant first commenced raising concerns with the respondent over the patent, and apparently the parties have been engaged in discussions over the past few weeks. I am unaware of how long its current legal representatives have been acting on the respondent's behalf. In these circumstances I am not of the view that an order for costs on an indemnity basis would be just and appropriate. Order 62 rule 3 In oral submissions, Mr Logan pressed that a costs order of some nature ought to be made today and that this is a case where an order allowing the applicant to tax its costs forthwith is warranted. The applicant submits that due to the conduct of the respondent significant additional costs in preparation for the interlocutory hearing have been incurred. Federal Court Rules O 62 r 3 provides: 'An order for costs of an interlocutory proceeding shall not, unless the Court otherwise orders, entitle a party to have a bill of costs taxed until the principal proceedings in which the interlocutory order is made is concluded or further order.' I am not persuaded that this is an appropriate circumstance in which to order that costs be taxed and paid forthwith. I note the observations of Emmett J in Brasington v Overton Investments Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 571 where his Honour considered the rationale for the rule: 'The rationale for such a provision appears to me to be that, since an interlocutory proceeding does not resolve the final issue between the parties, it would, in ordinary circumstances, be inappropriate that an unsuccessful party in an interlocutory proceeding be required to pay costs immediately, as that party might ultimately be entitled to an order for costs in the substantive proceeding. The general principle appears to be that costs ought to be resolved when the proceeding has been concluded, and the rights of the parties have been finally determined.' The rule, of course anticipates that there will be some circumstances where the general principle should be diverted from. As discussed earlier in this judgment I am not persuaded that this is a case where the applicant has incurred significant additional costs by reason of the respondent's conduct in respect of this litigation. While the respondent has failed to appear today and has not entered a notice of appearance I am not persuaded that the applicant would have incurred less costs if the respondent had appeared before me today. While the applicant has incurred considerable costs in this matter in relation to its intellectual property rights the situation is not one of special circumstances such as to divert from the general principles. The future course of this litigation may shed more light on the conduct of the respondent such as to justify special orders as to costs however, in my view, having not had the benefit of submissions from the respondent today, the appropriate order is that the issue of costs be reserved. CONCLUSION It is unfortunate that the respondent has not appeared today. However in view of the evidence presented by the applicant, I am persuaded that it would be appropriate to grant the applicant the interlocutory relief it seeks. In oral submissions, the applicant pressed for permanent relief to be granted by the Court today. However I am not persuaded on the facts that it would be an appropriate order. Notwithstanding the failure of the respondent to appear today, I note that the matter has been treated by all parties and indeed conducted by the applicant in the lead up to the hearing this morning as an application for interlocutory relief. On that basis, it is reasonable to presume that the respondent was expecting to have its day in court when the application for permanent relief was heard. Accordingly, I make orders as follows: 1. Upon the undertaking of the applicant: (a) to submit to such order (if any) as the Court may consider to be just for the payment of compensation, in an amount to be assessed by the Court or as it may direct, to the respondent should it be found that it has been adversely affected by the operation of the interlocutory order set out in par 2 below or any continuation (with or without variation) thereof; and (b) to pay such compensation referred to in par 1(a) above and as directed by the Court; 2. Until the trial of this proceeding, or further order, an interlocutory injunction to restrain the respondent whether by itself, its directors, officers, servants, agents or otherwise howsoever during the term of Australian Innovation Patent No 200310063 ('the patent') or any extension thereof from infringing the patent, including by the importing, making, offering to make, selling, offering for sale, disposing of, offering to dispose of, using, or keeping for the purpose of doing any of those things, the insulation product known as Super Bubble, or authorising the doing of any of those acts. 3. Costs be reserved. I certify that the preceding thirty-nine (39) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.

"I have already noted, the applicant is the registered proprietor of a patent which has been certified and remains in force. In order to establish infringement of the patent, the applicant must show that the respondent has taken each and every one of the essential integers of the relevant claims. This principle was considered by the Full Court in Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd (2005) FCAFC 220 at par 49 where their Honours said, referring to the earlier Full Court decision in Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 59 FLR 37: 'There is no infringement if the patentee has, by the form of the claim, left open what the alleged infringer has done. Their Honours [in Populin] stated, as a fundamental rule, the test for infringement as set out in Rodi &amp; Wienenbirger AG v Henry Showell Ltd [1969] RPC 367 that there will be no infringement unless the alleged infringer has taken all of the essential features or integers of the patentee's claim. This principle was reaffirmed by Gummow J in Nicaro Holdings v Martin Engineering (1990) 91 ALR 513 at 527 (par 49).'",Legal Documents,,,
"Federal Court has power to grant interlocutory relief pursuant to s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) and s 122(1) Patents Act 1990 (Cth). The principles relevant to the exercise of that power are: 1. There must be a serious question to be tried or a prima facie such that if the evidence remains the same there is a probability that at a final hearing it will be entitled to relief. 2. The applicant will suffer irreparable harm for which damages will not be an adequate compensation, unless an injunction is granted. 3. The balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction.

"of the administration of justice is one thing; the ability freely to inspect every document on the Court's file is another. So much is evident from the structure of O 46 r 6. Rule 6(2) lists out those types of document which may be inspected as of right with r 6(3) then providing that the ability to inspect other types of document requires a grant of leave. As to the latter, while there may be a general disposition to permit a non-party to have access to such non-confidential affidavits and exhibits as are admitted into evidence: Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 9) [2005] FCA 1394 ; (2005) 148 FCR 1 , at [26], the extent of further access must in each case be considered on its merits.

"This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court (Phipps FM): Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2005] FMCA 1821. In hearing and determining the appeal, I am exercising the powers of the Full Court pursuant to a determination by the Chief Justice under s 25(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). 2 Phipps FM dismissed the appellant's application to set aside a bankruptcy notice served on him by the respondent. Before the Magistrate, the appellant put forward three bases for the setting aside of the notice. 3 The first basis was that the notice was based on a debt that had been paid. 24 Leaving aside the gratuitous insult in ground (h), the Magistrate was hardly obliged to deal with an issue that was not raised before him. It follows that I also do not need to deal with it. Grounds (b) and (h) must fail. In any case, I agree with what Hayne J said to the appellant about the issue in Moran v Lydiard Financial Services Pty Ltd [2004] HCATrans 562: ""These arguments are variants on arguments that have sometimes been put in the Court. They are arguments that always end up proving far too much, Mr Moran, as they are arguments that, if they had any legs which they do not it would demonstrate that there was no ownership of land, there was no Corporations Law, and the arguments of a kind commonly deployed to demonstrate that somebody does not owe taxation. It always proved too much."" 25 Ground of appeal (c) relates to the note. It must also fail. 26 The Magistrate said at [5] that: ""A promissory note does not constitute payment for costs, It was returned by [solicitors for the respondent] by return mail in which they said it did not constitute legal tender. A promissory note cannot constitute payment in the absence of acceptance of the promissory note or agreement that payment is to be made by promissory note. Neither of those two things exist here. In addition, there is no evidence of an ability to satisfy the promissory note. Finally, it needs to be said, the order for costs made by the Court of Appeal contained no stay, nor did the Master's order fixing the amount of the costs. The promissory note, on its face, is payable at 4pm on 31 January 2025. ...""",Legal Documents,,,
"According to the appellant, grounds of appeal (a) and (g) fix on what the Magistrate said at [15] and [16]: ""[The appellant] is seeking to satisfy the Court that he has a counter-claim, set-off or cross-demand as those terms are used in s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). It is not sufficient for a debtor to assert that he has a claim and then set out the basis for the claim. He must satisfy the Court that he has a genuine demand. The Court must be satisfied it has a reasonable prospect of success. I refer to Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223 at [52] as one of the authorities for that proposition. The debtor must show that he has a prima face case even if he does not adduce the admissible evidence which would make out a prima facie case (Ebert v Union Trustee Co of Australia Ltd [1960] HCA 50 ; (1960) 104 CLR 346 at 350). The [appellant] does not show that he has a claim to pursue. He has attempted to establish a claim in the Supreme Court of Victoria and the proceeding has been dismissed. He has lodged an appeal against the decision of Mandie J, but that does not establish that his claim has any merit or any prospects of success, whether he has a prima facie case or a reasonable prospect of success."" As noted at [6], the appeal against the decision of Mandie J is stayed pending the provision of security for costs. 12 Ground of appeal (a) is misconceived. The Magistrate did not ""assume the outcome of [that] appeal"". He did what the authorities (ie Bhagat and Ebert ) called upon him to do: namely, make an assessment solely for the purposes of the application before him of the prospects of success of the appeal. In making that assessment, he did not purport to decide the outcome of that appeal: the Court of Appeal is not bound to agree with that assessment if and when it comes to decide the appeal. Further, the Magistrate could only have made that assessment on the basis of ""submissions and affidavit material"".",Legal Documents,,,
"The appellant relies on the following passage in PP McQuade and MGR Gronow, McDonald , Henry and Meek: Bankruptcy Law and Practice (5 th edn, 1996) at [40.1.335]: ""A creditor who, after he or she has served a bankruptcy notice, takes from the debtor a bill of exchange or promissory note for the debt, cannot, during the currency of the bill or the note, obtain a sequestration order founded on the notice, since, until the bill or note is dishonoured, it must be treated as payment (Ex parte Matthew; Re Matthew (1884) 12 QBD 506) and the position is the same, if, although dishonoured, it is in the hands of a third person to whom it has been endorsed for value by the creditor: Re Debtor [1908] 1 KB 344."" That passage does not assist the appellant. It assumes that the creditor has accepted the note. That the author uses the word ""take"" in that sense is made clear when one reads the two cases to which he refers. In each of those cases, the note had been accepted. For the same reason, each of those cases can be distinguished from the instant case.",Legal Documents,,,

"Reference should also be made to the judgment of Toohey J in Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) 19 FCR 10 ( Hughes ). 72 Toohey J in Hughes summarised the position up until 1986, saying, at 20: The last few years have seen several decisions, particularly by the High Court, in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined. It is not my intention to refer to those decisions in great detail but rather to state the principles that appear to emerge from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case. 1. The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation: R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543, 562 (St George County Council); R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190 at 219, 234 (Adamson). 2. The purpose of incorporation, propounded in St George County Council, is no longer a valid test. The test is one of the current activities of the corporation: Adamson; State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 at 304; (1982) ATPR 40-326 at 43,976-43,977 (State Superannuation Board). 3. But the current activities test is not the sole criterion for determining whether a corporation is a trading corporation. Thus where a corporation has not begun to trade, its character may be found in its constitution. Even when there are current activities, the corporation's constitution is not completely irrelevant: Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 602; (1983) ATPR 40-350 at 44,218. 4. Views as to the necessary extent of trading activity have varied. It must be a substantial corporate activity (Barwick CJ in Adamson at 208); the trading activities must form a sufficiently significant proportion of the corporation's overall activities (Mason J in Adamson at 233, with Jacobs J concurring at 237); the trading activities should not be insubstantial (Murphy J in Adamson at 239); the corporation must carry on trading activities on a significant scale: (Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ in State Superannuation Board at 304; 43,976-43,977; Deane J in Commonwealth v Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 57 ALJR 450 at 559-560. 5. An incorporated sporting body can be a trading corporation if its activities meet the required test: Adamson. 6. In particular, incorporation under a statute such as the Associations Incorporation Act does not prevent a corporate body from being a trading corporation if its activities warrant that description: Adamson at 232. 7. Trading denotes the activity of providing, for reward, goods or services: Re Ku-ring-gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Ltd (1978) 36 FLR 134 at 139; St George County Council at 569-570; Bevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse [1985] FCA 134 ; (1985) 7 FCR 325 at 330-331; (1985) ATPR 40-565 at 46,568. 8.

[footnote omitted] This understanding of the power should be adopted. It follows, as Gaudron J said, [2000] HCA 34 ; [(2000) 203 CLR 346 at 375 [83] ; [2000] HCA 34 ; 172 ALR 257 at 275; [2000] HCA 34] that the legislative power conferred by s 51(xx) ""extends to laws prescribing the industrial rights and obligations of corporations and their employees and the means by which they are to conduct their industrial relations"". 19 The majority concluded, in [198]: ... A law which prescribes norms regulating the relationship between constitutional corporations and their employees, or affecting constitutional corporations in the manner considered and upheld in Fontana Films or, as Gaudron J said in Re Pacific Coal, [2000] HCA 34 ; [(2000) 203 CLR 346 at 375 [83] ; [2000] HCA 34 ; 172 ALR 257 at 275] ""laws prescribing the industrial rights and obligations of [constitutional] corporations and their employees and the means by which they are to conduct their industrial relations"" are laws with respect to constitutional corporations. 20 In essence, the High Court, by a majority, concluded that the Work Choices Act was valid in its application to constitutional corporations. The central question in these two proceedings is whether the Etheridge Shire Council is such a corporation. 21 If it is, the acceptance by the majority in the Work Choices Case of the ambit of the power of the Commonwealth under s 51(xx) as described by Gaudron J in Pacific Coal , would mean that the Commonwealth has power to regulate the activities, functions, relationships and the business of the Etheridge Shire Council; the creation of rights and privileges belonging to the Etheridge Shire Council; the imposition of obligations on it; and, in respect of those matters, the regulation of the conduct of those through whom it acts, its employees, and also the regulation of those whose conduct is or is capable of affecting its activities, functions, relationships or business.",Legal Documents,,,

"And finally, there are observations by Heerey J in Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358 , which are apposite in the context of the affidavit material filed in the present application. Heerey J said of the case before him at [17]: ... Mr Meyers has filed a substantial amount of affidavit material sworn by himself and others. However, it needs to be kept in mind that the issue is not whether his version of events is more plausible than Andi-Co's, but whether the alleged debts are the subject of genuine disputes and whether the alleged offsetting claims are genuine, that is to say, real and authentic as opposed to false, illegitimate, phoney, counterfeit and false. Accordingly, I shall not engage in an assessment of the rival merits. 18 The plaintiff asserts two offsetting claims. The first of the offsetting claims relates to what is said to be a genuine claim of the plaintiff against the defendant for the infringement of three patents, arising out of the defendant's manufacture and sale of water meter assemblies. 19 The second offsetting claim relates to an order for costs made in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant by me on 9 August 2004 in action Q69 of 2003.",Legal Documents,,,

"Such an order was made by Hely J in Fleur De Lys Pty Ltd v Jarrett (2004) 51 ACSR 238. 56 The application by the plaintiff seeks an order for costs on an indemnity basis, relying on the fact that its solicitor had corresponded with the solicitor for the defendant indicating that the plaintiff claimed that it had a cross demand for damages for infringement of patents. The defendant nonetheless persisted in resisting the setting aside of the statutory demand. 57 In my opinion, it is not appropriate that there be an order for costs on an indemnity basis.",Legal Documents,,,
"Austin J in Gujarat NRE Australia v Williams [2006] NSWSC 518 said: [20] Effectively, the standard to be reached to persuade a court that there is an offsetting claim is the same as the standard to be reached to persuade a court that there is a genuine dispute between the alleged debtor and the party claiming to be creditor. The most effective cited description of the standard for establishing a genuine dispute is a passage in the judgment of McLelland CJ in Eq in Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 785 at 787. There, his Honour said that the expression ""genuine dispute"" connotes a plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much the same sort of considerations as the ""serious question to be tried"" criterion which arises in an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the extension or removal of a caveat. [21] It is of fundamental importance for parties to proceedings of this kind to understand that the court does not enter into the merits of any dispute between the parties. The court merely satisfies itself, to the standard described by McLelland CJ in Eq, that the dispute, or the assertion of an offsetting claim, is ""genuine"". If it is, then the statutory demand procedure is out of place. The whole purpose of the reforms introduced to corporate insolvency law, when the present Pt 5.4 was introduced, was to remove litigation about disputed claims from the winding up process. That is why courts have said, time and again, that if a creditor is aware that there is a dispute, asserted on behalf of the alleged debtor with sufficient plausibility to meet that relatively low threshold described by his Honour, issuing a statutory demand is wholly inappropriate. The correct course is to have the dispute resolved by proceedings asserting the debt.",Legal Documents,,,
"Having regard to the expert evidence of Mr Fox, the claims are, it seems to me, genuine claims put forward in good faith, and which are more than mere assertion. The claims are seriously disputed, as the expert evidence of Mr Collins demonstrates. Without looking too deeply at the issues of validity and infringement, the claims of the plaintiff in respect of damages for infringement are such that they have "" some real chance of success "", to use the words of Young J in Intag Microelectronics Pty Ltd v AWA Ltd (1995) 18 ACSR 284 at 289. 41 In my opinion, the conclusion that there is an offsetting claim in respect of the costs orders made by the Court on 9 August 2004 are even stronger. 42 On that day, the Court ordered that the decision of the AAT to affirm the decision of the Commissioner of Patents to decline an extension of time was set aside, and the matter was remitted to the AAT for consideration according to law. The Court ordered that the second respondent pay the costs of the applicant to be taxed if not agreed.",Legal Documents,,,
"Palmer J in Macleay Nominees Pty Ltd v Belle Property East Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 743 at [18] said: In my opinion, a genuine offsetting claim for the purposes of CA s 459H (1) and (2) means a claim on a cause of action advanced in good faith, for an amount claimed in good faith. 'Good faith' means arguable on the basis of facts asserted with sufficient particularity to enable the Court to determine that the claim is not fanciful. In a claim for unliquidated damages for economic loss, the Court will not be able to determine whether the amount claimed is claimed in good faith unless the plaintiff adduces some evidence to show the basis upon which the loss is said to arise and how that loss is calculated. If such evidence is entirely lacking, the Court cannot find that there is a genuine offsetting claim for the purposes of s 459H.",Legal Documents,,,
"The expression "" genuine claim "" was considered by Hayne J in the Supreme Court of Victoria in Mibor Investments Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1993) 11 ACSR 362, where his Honour said: ... any application to set aside a statutory demand must be made very quickly; it must be made within 21 days. Second, the statute contemplates a summary procedure, the only outcome of which will be an order affecting the statutory demand, not an order or judgment declaring a debt to be owing or not to be owing or ordering payment of any money sum. Third, the only significance that the statutory demand has is that if there is a failure to comply with it then the company is deemed to be insolvent. Thus the demand is no more than a precursor to an application for winding up in insolvency. Fourth, an application to wind up in insolvency must be determined within 6 months (unless the court is satisfied that special circumstances justify an extension of that time): s 459R. Firth, on the hearing of the application to wind up, the company may not oppose the application on grounds that it might have taken in any application to set aside the demand, unless those grounds are material to proving that the company is solvent. 11 Hayne J then said: These matters, taken in combination, suggest that at least in most cases, it is not expected that the court will embark upon any extended inquiry in order to determine whether there is a genuine dispute between the parties and certainly will not attempt to weigh the merits of that dispute. All that the legislation requires is that the court conclude that there is a dispute and that it is a genuine dispute.",Legal Documents,,,
"To like effect are the observations of Thomas J in the Supreme Court of Queensland in Re Morris Catering (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACSR 601, where his Honour said at 605-606: There is little doubt that Division 3 is intended to be a complete code which prescribes a formula that requires the Court to assess the position between the parties and preserve demands where it can be seen that there is no genuine dispute and no sufficient genuine offsetting claim. That is not to say that the Court will examine the merits or settle the dispute. The specified limits of the Court's examination are the ascertainment of whether there is a ""genuine dispute"" and whether there is a ""genuine claim"".",Legal Documents,,,
"Litigation involving those petty patents in the Federal Court [(1999) 47 IPR 525] resulted in the plaintiff losing on the issue of entitlement, Cooper J otherwise being satisfied that the invention was a manner of new manufacture and was also novel, inventive, and useful. 28 Mr Fox says: 5. GST [the plaintiff] is also the Patentee of three more recent patents (""the three new patents"") which also derive from application No. 85236/91 as divisional either directly or indirectly, those patents being No. 780782 (32815/95), No. 781173 (46033/01), and No. 781174 (43779/01) and all three new patents relate to the same ""invention"" as the two petty patents previously mentioned. In fact, the claims of patent No: 781174 are identical to the claims of one of the petty patents, namely, No: 645740. The claims of patent No: 781173 are identical to the claims of the other petty patent, namely, No: 662284. 29 The tenor of his evidence is that those commercially sold water meter assemblies infringe the patents of the plaintiff.",Legal Documents,,,
"The power given to the Court under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act to forbid or restrict the publication of evidence should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances. Section 50 makes it clear that the power should only be exercised in order to prevent ""prejudice to the administration of justice or the security of the Commonwealth"". In the present case ASIC's concerns relate to prejudice to the administration of justice. It is a fundamental principle of the administration of justice in Australia that the administration of justice be open justice. When considering whether to exercise the power given by s 50 a Court must bear in mind the need to do justice between all relevant parties, taking as its initial position the principle of open justice. The manner in which a Court should approach an application under s 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act to restrict the publication of evidence was considered by a Full Court of the Federal Court in Applicant Y v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2005] FCAFC 222. The Full Court said at pars [14] and [15]: ""The public interest, that the Court should effectively endeavour to achieve in considering the exercise of power under s 50, is the object of doing justice between the parties. That is the function that the Court is appointed to discharge. Where refusal to make an order might well undermine or defeat the purpose of achieving justice between the parties, and disappoint the public interest in having the Court deal responsibly with the affairs of citizens, it may be appropriate to make an order pursuant to s 50 ... The Court must, however, take into account what s 50 does not explicitly state, but is the underlying assumption upon which it is based, namely, the principle of open justice. The importance of the principle of open justice is not in doubt. On the other hand, the possibility of prejudice to the administration of justice must be weighed against the public interest in maintaining open justice. Although the principle of open justice is of great importance in exercising the discretion under s 50, it is not necessarily the whole weight of that principle that must be placed on the scales. The derogation from the principle that might be involved in making an order under s 50 may be very great, or it might be very small. The degree of derogation from the principle involved in the proposed order is an important matter to be considered in balancing the principle against possible prejudice to the administration of justice ...""

"The basis upon which the Court should approach an application under s 17(4) of the Federal Court of Australia Act is similar to the approach it should take in relation to an application under s 50. The power to order the exclusion of persons from a hearing should only be exercised in exceptional cases. It is clear from s 17(4) that that power should only be exercised in circumstances where not to exercise it would be ""contrary to the interests of justice"". The primary principle is that the principle of open justice is to be observed in that Court hearings should be open to the public and only closed where the interests of justice require that closure. As Earl Loreburn said in Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417 at 445: ""The inveterate rule is that justice shall be administered in open Court."" His Lordship accepted that it was appropriate in the interests of justice that the doors of the Court be closed when the subject-matter of the action would be destroyed by a hearing in open court.",Legal Documents,,,
"In Raybos Australia Pty Ltd v Jones [1985] 2 NSWLR 47, Kirby P (as he then was) said at 55: ""Many cases report the scrutiny by courts of statutory provisions designed to derogate from the open administration of justice. Running through these decisions is a common theme. It is that, by our tradition, the open administration of justice is the rule. Statutory derogation from openness is the exception. In the defence of the rule, such statutes will usually be strictly and narrowly construed. Unless the derogation is specifically provided for, courts are loathe to expand the field of secret justice ..."" Samuels JA, in the course of analysing whether the publication of the names in suit would defeat the ends of justice, said at 61: ""The inquiry must start with the proposition, central to our notions of forensic procedure, that the courts customarily conduct their business in public in order that the integrity, fairness and efficiency of the system, and its administrators, may be maintained by its exposure to public scrutiny."" 22 The applicant submitted that ASIC should disclose in open hearing what was the reasoning process to support the protection of the information sought by ASIC without disclosing what that information was. It submitted that it should, to the extent possible, identify the reasons why the information was being withheld without disclosing the information. The difficulty with acceding to that submission is that exposing the reasoning process would inevitably disclose the information sought to be protected. There were also a number of matters in respect of the claim for public interest immunity privilege raised in the confidential material which I wanted to discuss with counsel for ASIC but it was not possible to do this in open session without exposing the information that ASIC sought to protect. 23 The difficulty with which I was faced in this application by ASIC was that in order to determine whether orders should be made under ss 17(4) and 50 of the Federal Court of Australia Act I must have regard to the confidential affidavits (not served on the parties) filed by ASIC and its confidential submissions (not served on the parties) in order to understand the basis for the application. I reached the conclusion that in order to preserve the subject-matter of ASIC's claim for public interest immunity privilege I was compelled to make orders under ss 17(4) and 50 of the Federal Court Act in order to avoid prejudice to the administration of justice. If I had not made such orders I would have destroyed the basis for ASIC's claim. The hearing of ASIC's claim in the presence of the parties to the proceeding would have disclosed the very subject-matter and issues which ASIC claimed were protected from disclosure by the public interest immunity privilege. I therefore heard ASIC's application in camera in the absence of the parties to the proceeding.",Legal Documents,,,
"The formulation of the content of that contract however requires some attention. People do not always conduct their business dealings in classic text book terms of offer and acceptance. In Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110 at 11,117-11,118 McHugh JA (Hope and Mahoney JJA concurring) said: ""... in an ongoing relationship, it is not always easy to point to the precise moment when the legal criteria of a contract have been fulfilled. Agreements concerning terms and conditions which might be too uncertain or too illusory to enforce at a particular time in the relationship may by reason of the parties' subsequent conduct become sufficiently specific to give rise to legal rights and duties. In a dynamic commercial relationship new terms will be added or will supersede older terms. It is necessary therefore to look at the whole relationship and not only at what was said and done when the relationship was first formed."" His Honour also remarked (ibid): ""...it is an error to suppose that merely because something has been done then there is therefore some contract in existence which has thereby been executed ... Nevertheless, a contract may be inferred from the acts and conduct of parties as well as or in the absence of their words. The question in this class of case is whether the conduct of the parties, viewed in the light of the surrounding circumstances, shows a tacit understanding or agreement. The conduct of the parties, however, must be capable of proving all the essential elements of an express contract."" These statements were subsequently applied by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Brambles Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council [2001] NSWCA 61 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 153 at [74] - [77] (Heydon JA, Mason P concurring) and the Full Court of the Federal Court in Damevski v Giudice [2003] FCAFC 252 ; (2003) 133 FCR 438 at [82] - [88] (Marshall J, Wilcox J concurring).",Legal Documents,,,
"Counsel for the defendants submitted that the term in question, being an indemnity, should be construed strictly against the Hydro. However, this principle of construction is bound up with another rule, that documents should be construed contra proferentem (against the interest of the party which prepared or drafted the document): Coghlan v S H Lock (Australia) Ltd (1987) 8 NSWLR 88 at 92, Andar Transport Pty Ltd v Brambles Ltd [2004] HCA 28 ; (2004) 217 CLR 424 at [19] , Halford v Price [1960] HCA 38 ; (1960) 105 CLR 23 at 30, 34, 40, 41. However, in the present case it is the Commonwealth which was the drafter or presenter of the document. One can infer that seeking to have a Commonwealth employee placed with an outside employer for the purposes of rehabilitation is a common occurrence. Since this is a benefit to Comcare and the Commonwealth (successful rehabilitation will lessen their financial burden), it is hardly surprising that the Commonwealth and/or Comcare would adopt a standard form of contract in which the outside employer is indemnified against the obvious possibility of liability for workplace injury. The present case is the reverse of the stereotypical situation where the party in the stronger bargaining position imposes a standard term on the weaker party: see Andar at [69] per Kirby J.",Legal Documents,,,
"I do not think the orders made by the Tribunal which are under challenge constitute a decision under s 44(1) of the AAT Act. The substantive application before the Tribunal was an application for review of the delegate's decision under s 13 of the Act not to grant a certificate of Australian citizenship to the respondent. The right to bring the application for review is contained in s 52A of the Act. The orders of the Tribunal defer or adjourn consideration of the application for review. The orders do not amount to a final decision or determination. In accordance with well-established authority the orders therefore do not constitute a decision within s 44(1) of the AAT Act: Director-General of Social Services v Chaney (1980) 3 ALD 161 per Deane J, with whom Fisher J agreed, at 178, 180; Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 (' Bond ') per Mason CJ at 335; Geographical Indications Committee v The Honourable Justice O'Connor (2000) 64 ALD 325 at 332-333.

"PCR has submitted that it is not the true 'aggressor' in the present application and relies upon the decision of Wilcox J in Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd and Anor (1988) 88 ALR 63 (' Amalgamated Mining '). In those proceedings Amalgamated Mining sought a declaration that statements contained in a letter from Warman's solicitors alleging that Warman's copyright had been breached by Amalgamated Mining's supplier were unjustified. In deciding that Amalgamated Mining should not be required to pay security for costs, Wilcox J said (at 67-8): 'If one applies the homely test adopted by Scrutton LJ [in Maatschappij Voor Fondsenbezit v Shell Transport and Trading Co and Ors [1923] 2 KB 166] of asking who, in the litigation, was the attacker and who was the defender, I think it must be said that the first attack came in the letter from [Warman's solicitors] . Although the letter was not written directly to Amalgamated Mining, it is that company which has an interest in defending and, in a commercial sense, probably has very little alternative other than to take that course. I think that it is an accurate analysis of the matter to say, therefore, that it is the respondents to the principal proceeding who are the attackers and that Amalgamated Mining is, in substance, the defender.' His Honour also referred to the decision of the High Court in Willey v Synan [1935] HCA 76 ; (1935) 54 CLR 175. 31 I consider the facts of the present case to be different from those in Amalgamated Mining and Willey v Synan . Those were both cases in which proceedings had been instigated to forestall a threat by a respondent to existing entitlements of the applicant. In these proceedings the respondents have not threatened existing rights of PCR. PCR does not have any specific entitlement to the licence. Although it is true that the decision of ACMA has led to PCR being unable to operate its radio station, PCR only ever held a temporary licence and never had an ongoing right to operate. It cannot be said that the action of either respondent deprived, or threatened to deprive, PCR of its rights such that it was forced to bring these proceedings to protect itself. Accordingly I do not consider that PCR can reasonably be construed as ' the party attacked ' in these proceedings, or that either of the respondents can be considered as the true attacker. 32 PCR also submits that GCB is joined only as an interested party, and not as an 'adversary' to PCR. PCR refers to the fact that no relief is sought against GCB specifically, and says that GCB was only joined in the present proceedings because Wilcox J had required its joinder in the previous litigation. PCR also refers to the fact that, despite the fact that PCR was successful before Wilcox J, GCB was not required to pay PCR's costs, which it submits recognised GCB's non-adversarial status in the proceedings. The submission is that GCB, although joined, has no real need to participate in these proceedings because no relief is claimed against it.",Legal Documents,,,
"The above considerations are to be construed in light of the fundamental right of a citizen to have access to the courts: see The Airtourer Co-operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1400 at [18] (' Airtourer '). As Morling J observed in Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 2 FCR 463 at 469: 'It has never been the case that impecuniosity on the part of a plaintiff is a ground for ordering him to give security for costs. In Pearson v. Naydler [1977] 1 W.L.R. 899, Megarry V-C said: ""The basic rule that a natural person who sues will not be ordered to give security for costs, however poor he is, is ancient and well-established. As Bowen L.J. said in Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch. D. 34 at 38, both at law and in equity 'the general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant'. The power to require security for costs ought not to be used so as to bar even the poorest man from the courts.""' However, as Branson J noted in Airtourer at [21]: 'Recognition by this Court of the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant has not meant that the Court has proceeded on the basis that an order for security for costs can never be made against a litigant. An order for security for costs is only rarely sought against a litigant who is not impecunious. An order for security for costs made against an impecunious litigant when justified by a factor other than mere impecuniosity does not offend the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant.'",Legal Documents,,,
"In an often-cited passage of the Full Federal Court, Sheppard, Morling and Neaves JJ in Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corporation (1984) 2 FCR 1 said at 4: 'In our opinion a court is not justified in declining to order security on the ground that to do so will frustrate the litigation unless a company in the position of the appellant here establishes that those who stand behind it and who will benefit from the litigation if it is successful (whether they be shareholders or creditors or, as in this case, beneficiaries under a trust) are also without means. It is not for the party seeking security to raise the matter; it is an essential part of the case of a company seeking to resist an order for security on the ground that the granting of security will frustrate the litigation to raise the issue of the impecuniosity of those whom the litigation will benefit and to prove the necessary facts.' 23 The fact that PCR has chosen to oppose the application without providing adequate evidence of its financial position poses a difficulty for the Court. However, given the evidence that PCR is a not-for-profit organisation managed by volunteers, I think it is reasonable to infer that those supporters will not benefit from the litigation in any pecuniary sense, especially since these proceedings seek administrative law remedies rather than damages.",Legal Documents,,,
"The application by GCB has been promptly brought, having been filed one day after the first return date for the application. PCR submitted that the motion was premature, because the leave application had not yet been heard. I see no reason why GCB should have waited until after the leave application before bringing its application for security for costs. Had it done so, it would have been open to PCR to submit that GCB had delayed in bringing an application for security for costs, by reason of which expenses had been incurred in prosecuting the application: see Buckley v Bennell Design and Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 308; Gartner v Ernst &amp; Young (No 3) [2003] FCA 1437 at [34] .

"Several authorities of this and other courts have considered the factors which should be taken into account in a security for costs application: see for example Equity Access Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation &amp; Ors (1989) ATPR 40-972 per Hill J; KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd and Ors (1995) 56 FCR 189 at 197-8 per Beazley J; Cultivaust Pty Ltd v Grain Pool Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1366 at [13] per Finn J; Chapman v Luminis Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 496 at [13] per Tamberlin J (' Chapman v Luminis '); Croker v Sydney Institute of TAFE (State of New South Wales) [2003] FCA 942 per Bennett J. In summary, those considerations are: 1) the chances of success of the applicant and whether the claim is bona fide; 2) the risk that the applicant could not satisfy a costs order; 3) whether the application for security for costs has been promptly brought; 4) whether the application for security for costs is being used oppressively to deny an impecunious litigant access to the court; 5) whether the applicant's impecuniosity arises out of the act in respect of which relief is sought; 6) whether there are third parties standing behind the applicant who are likely to benefit from the litigation and if so, whether they have proffered security for the costs of the litigation; 7) whether an order for security for costs would frustrate the litigation; 8) whether there are any public interest considerations to be taken into account; 9) any matters relevant to the discretion which are distinctive to the circumstances of the case. 16 I am unable at this early stage of proceedings to form a conclusion concerning the merits of the application. As Tamberlin J said in Chapman v Luminis at [17]: 'It is neither possible nor appropriate on a security for costs application to reach any firm conclusions as to the prospects of an appeal being successful beyond a general consideration of the reasons for decision and the formation of a general overview.' 17 Although the appeal is from a decision by ACMA rather than from a decision of this Court, I consider Tamberlin J's observations are pertinent. The notice of appeal in these proceedings makes numerous challenges to the decision-making process engaged in by ACMA, and I am not able to assess the merits of those challenges without investigating factual material. The fact that the appellant's challenge relates to the second decision of ACMA does not give rise to the inference that the appeal will not succeed. 18 PCR has not provided any direct evidence to the Court with respect to its incorporation, office-bearers, or financial position, although in its oral submissions it made brief reference to the fact that it was impecunious. The only evidence relating to the current financial status of PCR is the statement contained in the affidavit of Mr Norbert Lindberg, secretary of PCR, that the delay by PCR in bringing proceedings has resulted, in part, from the need to raise funds to finance the litigation. The Court has no information with respect to the success of PCR's fundraising activities and no recent financial statements have been produced. The Court has been provided with financial statements from 2003-2004 but because PCR was still operating the radio station and was in receipt of community grants at this time, the statements provide very little guidance as to the current finances of PCR. Since early 2004 PCR, because of the loss of its broadcasting licence, has not been eligible for the community grants which has presumably had an adverse effect on its financial position.",Legal Documents,,,

"The above considerations are to be construed in light of the fundamental right of a citizen to have access to the courts: see The Airtourer Co-operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1400 at [18] (' Airtourer '). As Morling J observed in Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 2 FCR 463 at 469: 'It has never been the case that impecuniosity on the part of a plaintiff is a ground for ordering him to give security for costs. In Pearson v. Naydler [1977] 1 W.L.R. 899, Megarry V-C said: ""The basic rule that a natural person who sues will not be ordered to give security for costs, however poor he is, is ancient and well-established. As Bowen L.J. said in Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch. D. 34 at 38, both at law and in equity 'the general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant'. The power to require security for costs ought not to be used so as to bar even the poorest man from the courts.""' However, as Branson J noted in Airtourer at [21]: 'Recognition by this Court of the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant has not meant that the Court has proceeded on the basis that an order for security for costs can never be made against a litigant. An order for security for costs is only rarely sought against a litigant who is not impecunious. An order for security for costs made against an impecunious litigant when justified by a factor other than mere impecuniosity does not offend the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant.' 27 I consider that the circumstances of the present case are, despite some similarities, also distinguishable from those considered by Branson J in Airtourer . That case involved an impecunious co-operative which was pursuing litigation out of a limited pool of funds. There was evidence before her Honour that the applicant planned to exhaust its funds to meet its own legal costs, leaving no funds in reserve for any costs order made against it. Branson J commented at [27]: 'I do not conclude that an order requiring the applicant to provide a relatively modest sum by way of security for costs would preclude the applicant from pursuing its application to the Court. It might require the directors of the applicant to request additional funds from members of the applicant but, as the proceeding is presumably being pursued by the applicant in the interests of its members, I see nothing inappropriate in such an outcome.' 28 Since PCR is a not-for-profit organisation which aims to provide radio broadcasts serving youth and ethnic minority groups, the proceedings are not being pursued by PCR in the interests of its 'members' so much as in the interests of the wider community group which it serves. I am not satisfied that volunteer members of a not-for-profit organisation should be required to provide funds for litigation when the organisation is impecunious. To impose such a requirement would mean a not-for-profit community organisation with a history of providing services to the public, which was legitimately bringing proceedings to the Court, might be prevented from pursuing an action to protect its interests merely on the ground of impecuniosity. This would, in my opinion, breach the principle that impecuniosity should not, without more, prevent a litigant from accessing the courts. 29 However, the difficulty which remains in this instance is that, because PCR has provided very limited information with respect to its financial status, members, objectives, any possible sources of funding and other relevant details, no conclusive finding can be made on the evidence as to the effect which an order for security for costs may have in these proceedings. Further, in the absence of a direct submission from PCR that the proceedings would be stifled if an order were made, I am unwilling to draw the inference that this consequence would follow.",Legal Documents,,,
"A further consideration is that PCR is not a mere nominal applicant. In this sense, the present facts are distinguishable from those considered by Hely J in Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd (2000) 34 ACSR 673, in which the applicant had no private right or interest. Hely J observed in that case at [37]: 'In my view, the fact that no private right or special interest of the applicant is involved in these proceedings is a factor which weighs in favour of making an order for security, rather than against it.' 25 His Honour added at [38]: 'If those who control the applicant wish to have the benefit of litigating when no private right or special interest of the applicant is at stake in the proceedings and when the applicant is impecunious, then it is appropriate that security for the respondent's costs be provided.'",Legal Documents,,,

"31A empowers the Court to award summary judgment in relation to a proceeding if satisfied that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of prosecuting it. The basis of the respondent Secretary's resort to s 31A is the contention that the applicant has not identified any question of law such as would enliven the Court's jurisdiction under s 44 of the AAT Act. Given that an appeal lies ""on a question of law"" only and not on a question of fact or of mixed law and fact: see Comcare v Etheridge [2006] FCAFC 27 at [11] - [17] the issues before me are whether such a question has been raised by Mr Kronen and whether his argument thereon is sufficiently strong to warrant the matter going to trial: Vranic v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2009] FCA 672.",Legal Documents,,,
"to this trio is Mr Kronen's conception of what is signified by the words ""to be negotiated"" in s 605(3). What is clear is that the level of permissible compromise and of required mutual agreement that this formula might otherwise suggest when used in other contexts, is radically curtailed in this statutory setting. Whether one can say that the ordinary meaning of ""negotiate"" is what is intended here (albeit what can be negotiated is limited by the Act and its purposes), hence the meaning is a question of fact: Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 280 at 287 (proposition 2); or that its meaning and hence proper construction is contrived by its legislative settings, hence are questions of law: Pozzolanic , 287 (propositions 1 and 4), what is clear is that Mr Kronen misapprehends the latitude the Act gives him. Elblematic of this was his presenting Maxima with negotiation procedures which included referral to an independent panel if any terms could not be agreed. If Mr Kronen is to qualify for a newstart allowance, he was required, in the circumstances, enter into an activity agreement: s 593(1)(e); he was required to undertake one or more activities that the Secretary regarded as suitable for the person: s 606(1); the terms of the agreement were to be approved by the Secretary. In this scheme, the ""right to negotiate"" could be illusory in quite some degree for some purposes and especially when the Secretary (or a delegate) takes decisions or actions in effectuation of the purposes of the Act itself. This is not to say that there was no room for discussion, accommodation and compromise. Rather, it is to recognise that the actual terms of the negotiation itself were something in relation to which the Secretary, acting reasonably and in good faith, could ultimately dictate, approve or disapprove, if there was to be an agreement. The Tribunal clearly understood this was the case: see Reasons [106]-[108]. It committed no error of law in construing and hence giving legal effect to the ""negotiation expectation"" of s 605(3) as it did. Further, the Tribunal satisfied itself on the evidence before it that the requirements Maxima sought to impose were reasonable and that those upon which Mr Kronen insisted were unreasonable in the circumstances. These fact findings were open to it and were unimpeachable in this proceeding.",Legal Documents,,,
"There is one case concerning par (ac). It is Port of Brisbane Corporation v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1232. That was an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and was therefore limited to questions of law. The decision appears to have been based upon a finding that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had considered irrelevant material in construing the relevant legislative provisions. In those circumstances, the decision can be of little assistance for present purposes. 35 This case depends upon the meaning of the expression ""in rail transport"". A considerable amount of time was spent in discussing the meaning of the word ""in"", in my opinion, not a particularly fruitful area of debate. To my mind, the more significant aspect is the word ""transport"", with any particular connotations that the word ""rail"" may contribute. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines the word ""transport"", used as a noun, to mean: 'transfer or conveyance of property ... the carrying or conveyance of a person or thing from one place to another ... a system or means of transportation or conveyance of people, goods etc ...' 36 The question depends substantially upon whether, in the present context, the word ""transport"" means the carriage or conveyance of persons or things or the system of transportation or conveyance. The Commissioner advanced the former view. Queensland Rail advanced the latter. The Commissioner submitted that the word ""in"" connoted such a close association between the use of the diesel fuel and the rail that it could only be satisfied if the usage occurred on the rail. Thus the movement of persons or goods (including Queensland Rail's own equipment) on rail would be included, but loading or unloading a train with loading equipment, which was not on-rail, would not. Similarly, the use of diesel fuel in rail-mounted track maintenance equipment would be included, but such use in non-rail mounted equipment would not. 37 This approach may give too much significance to the word ""rail"" which is used adjectivally to qualify the word ""transport"". The preposition ""in"" governs the noun ""transport"". In other words the phrase ""in rail transport"" means ""in transport which uses rail"". 38 If Parliament had intended that only use of diesel fuel in activities on-rail was to attract the rebate, it would have been easy to say so. Language analogous to the very specific language used for the purpose of excluding the rebate in the case of vehicles used on public roads and use relating to forestry might have been appropriate. Paragraphs (ad), (b), (c) and (d) are ""place-specific"" and might also have been appropriate models for a requirement that the relevant activity occur ""on-rail"".",Legal Documents,,,

"In Glueck v Stang (2008) 76 IPR 75 the applicant alleged that Novopharm, in trade or commerce, engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to an application to the Australian Patent Office for the grant of letters patent. At [32] to [33] Lindgren J said: The course of authority outlined above requires me to hold that the alleged representations by Novopharm to the APO ... were not made in trade or commerce. They were not made in the course of a trading or commercial relationship between Novopharm on the one hand, and ... the APO ... on the other hand. Novopharm had no trading or commercial dealings with the APO .... Nor were they made in the course of the negotiation of contracts .... The alleged representations were made to a government instrumentality pursuant to legislation for the purpose of obtaining an exclusive right or bundle of rights made available by that legislation. No doubt the alleged representations were made by Novopharm in trade or commerce in a broad non-s 52 sense. However, in Concrete Constructions the High Court ... rejected the view that the expression 'in trade or commerce' in s 52 referred to the 'immense field of activities' in which corporations may engage in the course of, or for the purposes of, carrying on some overall trading or commercial business .... 14 The applicant sought to distinguish the present case from Glueck on the ground that the facts of the two cases were different. That is true, but the proposition derived by Lindgren J from the authorities referred to is applicable here. Essentially that is because of the passage in Concrete Constructions at 604, upon which Glueck was based, in which it was said: What the section is concerned with is the conduct of a corporation towards persons, be they consumers or not, with whom it ... has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their nature, bear a trading or commercial character. It is that relationship that is absent here. I am not persuaded that Glueck is plainly wrong, and accordingly I should follow it.",Legal Documents,,,

"In my view delay in relation to the ADJR part of the proceeding is to be determined under s 11(4) and (5) and not under subs (3). In this case the applicant discovered the existence of the decision through its own resources. I agree with Pincus J in Australian Foreman Stevedores Association v Crone (1988) 20 FCR 377 that the expression ""furnished to the applicant"" contemplates delivery specifically to the applicant by the decision-maker. Accordingly the matter is to be approached under subss (4) and (5). 30 It is common ground that the alleged delay in relation to the s 192 and s 39B parts of the case are to be dealt with on the same basis as the ADJR aspect, so that relief may be refused if application was not made within a reasonable time. 31 A chronology of the relevant events will assist in understanding the parties' contentions on delay. 14 January 2000 Extension of term granted 12 March 2002 Applicant incorporated May 2003 Applicant signed agreement with EBEWE Pharma Late May 2005, 2006- 2007 Dr Schnait of EBEWE Pharma tells Mr Gray that while Lilly had an Austrian patent for the product he could find no equivalent patent in Australia 2 August 2007 Applicant becomes aware of Australian patent and extension of term 12 October 2007 Applicant obtains patent file from IP Australia 26 October 2007 Applicant's TGA application 5 December 2007 Applicant writes to Lilly contending that extension of term was wrong and seeking confirmation of this 18 December 2007 Lilly sends letter of demand as to infringement 20 December 2007 Applicant seeks without prejudice meeting with Lilly to discuss commercial resolution 11 January to 27 February 2008 Communications about without prejudice meeting 28 February 2008 Without prejudice meeting 6 March 2008 Negotiations break down; Lilly sends second letter of demand 18 March 2008 Applicant informed of Austrian injunction 19 March 2008 Applicant seeks review of extension",Legal Documents,,,
"The principles which ordinarily govern the exercise of the Court's discretion to award costs pursuant to s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) where an applicant no longer wishes to proceed were identified in Australian Securities Commission v Aust-Home Investments Ltd (1993) 44 FCR 194 at 201. Those principles, so far as presently relevant, may be summarised as follows. First, the Court should be ready to facilitate the conclusion of the proceeding by making a costs order. Secondly, although the Court will not ordinarily seek to determine the likely outcome of a hypothetical trial, it may be more ready to do so where the issues are simple and issues of credit do not arise. Thirdly, it will ordinarily be appropriate for the Court to consider the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties in instituting and defending the proceedings and it may be appropriate for the Court to consider whether unreasonable conduct of the respondent precipitated the commencement of the proceeding.",Legal Documents,,,
"The Bankruptcy Act recognises that the Court may extend the time for compliance with a bankruptcy notice where proceedings to set aside the judgment in respect of which the notice was issued have been instituted by the debtor (s 41(6A)(a)). The power to extend time for compliance is in aid of the power to set aside the notice itself should the judgment ultimately be set aside ( Byron v Southern Star Group Pty Ltd (1997) 73 FCR 264 at 268). The judgment upon which the bankruptcy notice was founded has now been set aside. I conclude that Mr George Elias acted reasonably in instituting this proceeding. 15 The trustee was entitled to serve the bankruptcy notice as no stay of execution of the District Court judgment had been sought (s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act ). I am not satisfied that he acted unreasonably in doing so. However, he must be assumed to have understood that, if the judgment were set aside on appeal, the judgment debt on which the bankruptcy notice was founded would no longer exist and the notice would be liable to be set aside. 16 The judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside the judgment of the District Court was unanimous. One member of the Court of Appeal was implicitly critical of the conduct of the trustee in opposing a stay of proceedings in the District Court to allow the s 139ZQ notice to be challenged in the Federal Magistrates Court (Giles JA at [51]). Another member of the Court of Appeal considered that there was 'some plausibility' in the contention that the District Court proceeding should have been stayed but found it unnecessary to consider the issue (Santow JA at [111]). The third member (Bryson JA) of the Court of Appeal also found it unnecessary to consider the issue. However, all members of the Court of Appeal concluded that the District Court erred in entering summary judgment against Mr George Elias. I infer that the District Court adopted this course at the invitation of the trustee. I incline to the view that, in this sense, unreasonable conduct of the trustee precipitated the events that led to the institution of this proceeding.",Legal Documents,,,

He argued that, once the holding summons for leave to appeal had been filed, it was inherently risky to serve the bankruptcy notice; the risk having eventuated, the trustee should pay the costs reasonably incurred by him with respect to the bankruptcy notice. 12 The trustee submitted that as no stay of the judgment of the District Court had been obtained, or indeed sought, he had acted reasonably and properly in serving the bankruptcy notice and in respect of the conduct of this proceeding.",Legal Documents,,,

"order sought by the second respondent (set out at [6] above) is sought under O 9 r 7(1)(a). In Cell Tech Communications Pty Ltd v Nokia Mobile Phones (UK) Ltd (1995) 58 FCR 365 ("" Cell Tech Communications ""), Lindgren J made a number of observations about the scope of O 9 r 7(1). His Honour said that the rule was to be distinguished from an application for summary dismissal (O 20 r 2) and an application for the striking out of pleading (O 11 r 16). To these I would add an application for summary judgment (Federal Court Act s 31A) and an order for dismissal which may follow the determination of a separate question under O 29 r 2. Lindgren J also made the point (at 370) that, although the other procedures he identified were to be distinguished from O 9 r 7, that was not to say that ""considerations relevant to such applications may not be relevant to an application under one or other of the paragraphs of O 9, r 7(1)"". The authorities establish that O 9 r 7(1) is not confined to cases where there has been service outside the jurisdiction. While O 9 r 7(1)(b), (c) and (d) refer to service of an originating process, (a) does not, and under that subparagraph an originating process may be set aside where the Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the claim made in it, or where the originating process constitutes an abuse of process: F Sharkey &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Fisher [1980] FCA 146 ; (1980) 50 FLR 130 ; 33 ALR 173 ; Cell Tech Communications (at 370). The second respondent's first ground (see [7] above) raises an issue of jurisdiction and, if made good, engages the power to set aside the originating process. By contrast, the second ground does not raise an issue of jurisdiction, and, even if made good, does not engage the power to set aside the originating process. I have not been able to find any direct authority addressing the submission by the second respondent that an originating process served within the jurisdiction may nevertheless be set aside because the applicant has no prima facie case on the merits. There is authority that it is not appropriate to exercise the power in O 9 r 7 on the ground that a party's pleadings are defective: Cell Tech Communications at 371 per Lindgren J. I do not think the power in O 9 r 7 extends to cases where the originating process has been served within the jurisdiction and a respondent claims that the applicant has no prima facie case on the merits. The rules, and now s 31A of the Federal Court Act, provide adequate procedures for a party who claims that the case against him or her has no substance. The second respondent's submission that I can order that the application be set aside under O 9 r 7 because the applicant does not have a prima facie case on the merits must be rejected. I would not permit the second respondent to call in aid s 31A of the Federal Court Act in circumstances where it was not referred to in the application or supporting affidavit and was only mentioned briefly in submissions. Jurisdiction In her application, the applicant relies on s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act and s 21 of the Federal Court Act. The important provision is s 39B(1A)(c) because s 21 gives this Court power to grant declarations only in those matters in which the Court has original jurisdiction.",Legal Documents,,,

"has been a good deal of debate in the authorities as to whether, in the case of a general statutory power to make declarations, and leaving aside a statutory intention to exclude the remedy of declaration, there are any jurisdictional limits on the power of the Court to make a declaration, or whether all the matters which from time to time have been identified in the authorities as relevant are no more than discretionary considerations (see, for example, the discussion of this issue by King CJ in J N Taylor Holdings Ltd (in liq) v Bond (1993) 59 SASR 432 at 436-437).

That was said by French J in IMF (Australia) Ltd v Sons of Gwalia Ltd (admin apptd) (2004) 211 ALR 231 ("" Sons of Gwalia "") at 243 [45] to be debatable. In Sons of Gwalia , French J considered a case involving a declaration as to the lawfulness of future conduct. His Honour said (at 243 [44]): ""In my opinion, the issue in the present application is neither hypothetical nor contingent. It involves a real question, namely whether IMF can lawfully proceed to do what it intends to do in using information on the Sons of Gwalia register to approach members and former members of the company with a view to joining them in possible recovery action against the company. The capacity of courts to declare that conduct, which has not yet taken place, will or will not be in breach of the law 'contributes enormously to the utility of the jurisdiction': Commonwealth of Australia v Sterling Nicholas Duty Free Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 19 ; (1972) 126 CLR 297 at 305; [1972-3] ALR 23."" In my opinion, there is a matter in this case and it arises under a law of the Parliament, namely, the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). There is a real controversy and the question raised is not an abstract or hypothetical question. It seems to me important not to confuse considerations relating to the desirability of the Tribunal ruling on the issue and then the matter proceeding by way of judicial review through the seeking of constitutional writs. Those considerations are relevant, perhaps highly relevant, to whether this Court should, as a matter of discretion, entertain the application for declaratory relief. They do not go to the question of whether there is a matter .",Legal Documents,,,

"have been considerable developments in the law relating to declarations since the decision in In re Judiciary and Navigation Acts . One of the leading High Court decisions in the area of declarations is Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421. That case dealt with the statutory power of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in s 10 of the Equity Act 1901 (NSW) to make a declaration. Gibbs J said (at 437) that it was neither possible nor desirable to fetter the broad discretion in s 10 by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise. His Honour said that, in general, the requirements identified by Lord Dunedin in Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank v British Bank for Foreign Trade Ltd [1921] 2 AC 438 should be satisfied before the discretion to make a declaration is exercised. In the latter case, Lord Dunedin said (at 448): ""The question must be a real and not a theoretical question; the person raising it must have a real interest to raise it; he must be able to secure a proper contradictor, that is to say, some one presently existing who has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought.""",Legal Documents,,,

"In my opinion, that is not correct. The procedure under s 37 of the Act is to review the decisions made by the trustee and insurer. The SCT needs to determine whether those decisions were correct when they were made. In Davis v Rio Tinto Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd [2002] FCAFC 376 ; (2002) 118 FCR 170 at 173-174 at [15], Heerey J said: Under s 37 of the Act the function of the Tribunal was to determine whether the decision of the Trustee was fair and reasonable in the circumstances: see National Mutual Life Association of Autralia Ltd v Campbell [2000] FCA 852 ; (2000) 99 FCR 562 and the cases therein cited. Counsel for the applicant submitted that the relevant time to consider whether the applicant was TPD within the meaning of the contract of insurance was 19 February 1999, that being six months from the date on which he last worked. I do not agree. What the Tribunal had to review and either affirm, vary or set aside was the decision of the Trustee made on 23 December 1999 and subsequently reviewed and affirmed by the Trustee on 1 June 2000 and 28 June 2000. Although not explicitly stated, it would seem that the Tribunal regarded its task as reviewing the decision of the Trustee as at the last mentioned date, an approach I think was correct. The system of review under the Act is to be distinguished from claims made by an insured under a policy: cf Giles v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (1986) 4 ANZ Ins Cas 60-751. See also Samaras v Australian Retirement Fund Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1323 per Gordon J at [18].",Legal Documents,,,
"The Court has the power to grant a stay in its discretion pursuant to O 52 r 17 of the Federal Courts Rules. The principles governing applications for a stay are settled. It is sufficient for the respondent to demonstrate that there is a reason or it is an appropriate case to warrant the exercise of the discretion: see Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corp (1996) 67 FCR 65 at 66. 6 The prima facie assumption is that the judgment appealed from is correct and the Court should not deprive a litigant of the benefit of a judgment in its favour. Counsel for the Union relied on this and opposed the grant of a stay upon the basis, first, that the appeal disclosed no arguable ground of appeal, alternatively, the prospects of success were weak; secondly, Ms Chester said all but three of the employees had indicated that they would repay the money if called upon to do so pursuant to a judgment of the Court on appeal; and, thirdly, the evidence for Prestige did not rise above speculation as to the difficulty of recovery. 7 According to counsel for Prestige, it proposed to challenge the judgment under appeal on two bases, first, that as a matter of construction the Victorian Arts Centre is not a premise of a state government instrumentality for the purposes of the relevant industrial awards in the ordinary sense of those words; and, secondly, as understood in context, having regard to relevant history, it was not such an instrumentality.",Legal Documents,,,

OutputFigure 1: Contracts often contain a small number of important clauses that warrant review or analysis,Legal Documents,,,
by lawyers. It is especially important to identify clauses that contain salient obligations or red flag,Legal Documents,,,
clauses. It can be tedious and expensive for legal professionals to manually sift through long contracts,Legal Documents,,,
"to find these few key clauses, especially given that contracts can be dozens or even more than 100",Legal Documents,,,
"pages long. The Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD) consists of over 500 contracts,",Legal Documents,,,
"each carefully labeled by legal experts to identify 41 different types of important clauses, for a total",Legal Documents,,,
"of more than 13,000 annotations. With CUAD, models can learn to automatically extract and identify",Legal Documents,,,
key clauses from contracts.,Legal Documents,,,
"To reduce the disparate societal costs of contract review, and to study how well NLP models generalize",Legal Documents,,,
"to specialized domains, we introduce a new large-scale dataset for contract review. As part of",Legal Documents,,,
"The Atticus Project, a non-profit organization of legal experts, we introduce CUAD, the Contract",Legal Documents,,,
Understanding Atticus Dataset (pronounced “kwad”). This dataset was created with a year-long effort,Legal Documents,,,
"pushed forward by dozens of law student annotators, lawyers, and machine learning researchers. The",Legal Documents,,,
"dataset includes more than 500 contracts and more than 13,000 expert annotations that span 41 label",Legal Documents,,,
"categories. For each of 41 different labels, models must learn to highlight the portions of a contract",Legal Documents,,,
most salient to that label. This makes the task a matter of finding needles in a haystack.,Legal Documents,,,
CUAD is especially valuable because it was made possible with the collective effort of many,Legal Documents,,,
"annotators. Prior to labeling, law student annotators of CUAD attended training sessions to learn",Legal Documents,,,
"how to label each of the 41 categories, which included video instructions by and live workshops with",Legal Documents,,,
"experienced lawyers, detailed instructions, and quizzes. Before annotating contracts for our dataset,",Legal Documents,,,
each law student annotator went through contract review training that lasted 70-100 hours. Annotators,Legal Documents,,,
also adhered to over 100 pages of rules and annotation standards that we created for CUAD. Each,Legal Documents,,,
annotation was verified by three additional annotators to ensure that the labels are consistent and,Legal Documents,,,
"correct. As a result of this effort, a conservative estimate of the pecuniary value of CUAD of is over",Legal Documents,,,
"$2 million (each of the 9283 pages were reviewed at least 4 times, each page requiring 5-10 minutes,",Legal Documents,,,
assuming a rate of $500 per hour). This cost underscores the unique value of the CUAD dataset.,Legal Documents,,,
"We experiment with several state-of-the-art Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) models on CUAD.",Legal Documents,,,
We find that performance metrics such as Precision @ 80% Recall are improving quickly as models,Legal Documents,,,
"improve, such that a BERT model from 2018 attains 8.2% while a DeBERTa model from 2021 attains",Legal Documents,,,
44.0%. We also find that the amount of labeled training annotations greatly influences performance,Legal Documents,,,
"as well, highlighting the value of CUAD for legal contract review.",Legal Documents,,,
"CUAD makes it possible to assess progress on legal contract review, while also providing an indicator",Legal Documents,,,
for how well language models can learn highly specialized domains. CUAD is one of the only,Legal Documents,,,

and entailment/question answering.,Legal Documents,,,
"While legal NLP covers a wide range of tasks, there is little prior work on contract review, despite the",Legal Documents,,,
fact that it is one of the most time-consuming and tedious tasks for lawyers. Chalkidis et al. (2017),Legal Documents,,,
introduce a dataset for extracting basic information from contracts and perform follow-up work with,Legal Documents,,,
"RNNs (Chalkidis et al., 2018). However, they focus on named entity recognition for a limited number",Legal Documents,,,

an order of magnitude fewer annotations than CUAD.,Legal Documents,,,
2.2 NLP Models for Specialized Domains,Legal Documents,,,
Transformers have recently made large strides on natural language tasks that everyday humans can,Legal Documents,,,
"do. This raises the question of how well these models can do on specialized tasks, tasks for which",Legal Documents,,,
"humans require many hours of training. To the best of our knowledge, CUAD is one of only the",Legal Documents,,,
large-scale NLP datasets that is explicitly curated for machine learning models by domain experts.,Legal Documents,,,
"This is also out of necessity, as there is no freely available source of contract review annotations that",Legal Documents,,,
"can be scraped, unlike for many other specialized domains.",Legal Documents,,,
"There is some prior work applying machine learning to specialized domains. For example, machine",Legal Documents,,,
"translation has been a long-standing challenge that similarly requires domain expertise. However,",Legal Documents,,,
"unlike contract review, supervised data for machine translation is generally scraped from freely",Legal Documents,,,
"available data (Bojar et al., 2014). More recently, Hendrycks et al. (2021b) propose a challenging",Legal Documents,,,
question answering benchmark that has multiple-choice questions from dozens of specialized areas,Legal Documents,,,
"including law, but the ability to answer multiple-choice legal questions does not help lawyers with",Legal Documents,,,
"their job. Similarly, there has been recent interest in applying language models to specialized domains",Legal Documents,,,
"such as math (Hendrycks et al., 2021c) and coding (Hendrycks et al., 2021a). Outside of NLP, in",Legal Documents,,,
"computer vision, machine learning has been applied to medical tasks such as cancer diagnosis that",Legal Documents,,,

3 CUAD: A Contract Review Dataset,Legal Documents,,,
Contract Review. Contract review is the process of thoroughly reading a contract to understand,Legal Documents,,,
the rights and obligations of an individual or company signing it and assess the associated impact.,Legal Documents,,,
Contract review is an application that is plausibly amenable to automation. It is widely viewed as one,Legal Documents,,,
of the most repetitive and most tedious jobs that junior law firm associates must perform. It is also,Legal Documents,,,
expensive and an inefficient use of a legal professional’s skills.,Legal Documents,,,
There are different levels of work in contract review. The lowest level of work in reviewing a contract,Legal Documents,,,
"is to find “needles in a haystack.” At this level, a lawyer’s job is to manually review hundreds of",Legal Documents,,,
pages of contracts to find the relevant clauses or obligations stipulated in a contract. They must,Legal Documents,,,
"identify whether relevant clauses exist, what they say if they do exist, and keep track of where they",Legal Documents,,,
are described. They must determine whether the contract is a 3-year contract or a 1-year contract.,Legal Documents,,,
"They must determine the end date of a contract. They must determine whether a clause is, say, an",Legal Documents,,,
anti-assignment clause or a most favored nation clause. We refer to this type of work as “contract,Legal Documents,,,
analysis.”,Legal Documents,,,
The highest level of work is to assess risk associated with the contract clauses and advise on solutions.,Legal Documents,,,
"At this level, a lawyer’s business client relies on them to explain not only what each clause means,",Legal Documents,,,
but also the implications such a clause has on its business and a transaction. This risk assessment,Legal Documents,,,
"work is highly contextual and depends on the industry, the business model, the risk tolerance and the",Legal Documents,,,
priorities of a company. This is highly skilled work that is done by experienced in-house lawyers,Legal Documents,,,
and law firm partners who are familiar with the clients’ business. We refer to this type of work as,Legal Documents,,,
“counseling.”,Legal Documents,,,

"Labels. In designing our dataset for contract review, we consider clauses that would warrant lawyer",Legal Documents,,,

reviewing a contract. The labels are broadly divided into the following three categories:,Legal Documents,,,
"• General information. This includes terms such as party names, document names, dates,",Legal Documents,,,
"governing laws, license grants, and renewal terms.",Legal Documents,,,
• “Restrictive covenants.” These are considered some of the most troublesome clauses because,Legal Documents,,,
they restrict the buyer’s or the company’s ability to operate the business.,Legal Documents,,,
• “Revenue risks.” These include terms that may require a party to a contract to incur additional,Legal Documents,,,

only about 0.25% each contract is highlighted,Legal Documents,,,
for each label.,Legal Documents,,,
Supplementary Annotations. For each label,Legal Documents,,,

"large sample of clauses that are difficult to find in the general population of contracts. For example,",Legal Documents,,,
"one company may have only one or two contracts that contain exclusivity clauses, while EDGAR",Legal Documents,,,
contracts may have hundreds of them.,Legal Documents,,,
Labeling Process. We had contracts labeled by law students and quality-checked by experienced,Legal Documents,,,
lawyers. These law students first went through 70-100 hours of training for labeling that was designed,Legal Documents,,,
"by experienced lawyers, so as to ensure that labels are of high quality. In the process, we also wrote",Legal Documents,,,
"extensive documentation on precisely how to identify each label category in a contract, which goes",Legal Documents,,,
into detail. This documentation takes up more than one hundred pages and ensures that labels are,Legal Documents,,,
consistent.,Legal Documents,,,
4 Experiments,Legal Documents,,,
4.1 Setup,Legal Documents,,,
Task Structure. We formulate our primary task as predicting which substrings of a contract relate,Legal Documents,,,
"to each label category. Specifically, for each contract and label category, we have annotations for",Legal Documents,,,
all of the substrings (if any) of that contract that should be highlighted. We then have a model learn,Legal Documents,,,
"the start and end token positions of the substring of each segment that should be highlighted, if any.",Legal Documents,,,
"This structure is similar to extractive question answering tasks such as SQuAD 2.0 (Rajpurkar et al.,",Legal Documents,,,

the minimum confidence threshold we use for determining what to count as prediction (while always,Legal Documents,,,

"Figure 3. The area under this curve is then the Area Under the Precision Recall curve (AUPR), which",Legal Documents,,,

"We can also analyze model performance at a specific confidence threshold, giving rise to “Precision",Legal Documents,,,
"@ X% Recall” measures. As shown in Figure 3, if we threshold the confidence such that the model",Legal Documents,,,
"has 80% recall, then we can analyze the model precision at that threshold. Notice that as the recall",Legal Documents,,,
"increases, the precision decreases. Consequently Precision @ 90% Recall is less than Precision @",Legal Documents,,,

We determine whether a highlighted text span matches the ground truth with the Jaccard similarity,Legal Documents,,,

"the set of words in a string, we first remove punctuation and make the string lower case, then we",Legal Documents,,,
"separate the string by spaces. Note that 0 ≤ J(A, B) ≤ 1, with J(A, B) = 0 when there is no",Legal Documents,,,
"intersection between A and B, and J(A, A) = 1 for any non-empty set A. We use the threshold",Legal Documents,,,
"0.5 ≤ J(A, B) for determining matches. We found that 0.5 provides a qualitatively reasonable",Legal Documents,,,
"threshold, as it requires sufficiently high overlap for a span to be counted as a valid match.",Legal Documents,,,
"Models. We evaluate the performance of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019),",Legal Documents,,,
"ALBERT (Lan et al., 2020), and DeBERTa (He et al., 2020). BERT is a bidirectional Transformer",Legal Documents,,,
that set state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks. RoBERTa improves upon BERT. RoBERTa,Legal Documents,,,
"uses the same architecture as BERT, but it was pretrained on an order of magnitude more data (160",Legal Documents,,,
"GB rather than BERT’s 16 GB pretraining corpus). ALBERT is similar to RoBERTa, but it uses",Legal Documents,,,
parameter sharing to reduce its parameter count. DeBERTa improves upon RoBERTa by using a,Legal Documents,,,
disentangled attention mechanism and by using a larger model size.,Legal Documents,,,
Training. More than 99% of the features generated from applying a sliding window to each contract,Legal Documents,,,
"do not contain any of the 41 relevant labels. If one trains normally on this data, models typically learn",Legal Documents,,,
"to always output the empty span, since this is usually the correct answer. To mitigate this imbalance,",Legal Documents,,,
we downweight features that do not contain any relevant labels so that features are approximately,Legal Documents,,,
balanced between having highlighted clauses and not having any highlighted clauses. For categories,Legal Documents,,,
"that have multiple annotations in the same document, we add a separate example for each annotation.",Legal Documents,,,
We chose a random split of the contracts into train and test sets. We have 80% of the contracts,Legal Documents,,,
make up the train set and 20% make up the test set. In preliminary experiments we set aside a small,Legal Documents,,,
"validation set, with which we performed hyperparameter grid search. The learning rate was chosen",Legal Documents,,,

"more than 20 times more parameters than its smallest version, it only performs around 3% percent",Legal Documents,,,
better. We find similar results with BERT as well; Table 2 shows only slight changes in the AUPR,Legal Documents,,,
from BERT-base (32.4%) to BERT-large (32.3%).,Legal Documents,,,
"On the other hand, model size seems to make an important difference in other cases. For example,",Legal Documents,,,
RoBERTa-base (42.6%) has noticeably lower performance than RoBERTa-large (48.2%). There are,Legal Documents,,,
"also large differences in performance across different models, with DeBERTa performing far better",Legal Documents,,,
"than BERT. This suggests that while model size does not consistently help, model design can still be",Legal Documents,,,
a path towards improving performance.,Legal Documents,,,
Performance as a Function of Training Data. We now assess how performance changes as a,Legal Documents,,,
function of dataset size. We restrict our attention to RoBERTa-base and compute the AUPR as we,Legal Documents,,,
"vary the amount of training data. In particular, we test performance after training on 3%, 10%, 30%,",Legal Documents,,,
and 100% of the training contracts. To account for the smaller number of gradient updates that comes,Legal Documents,,,
"from having less data, we increase the number of training epochs in grid search to make the number",Legal Documents,,,
"of gradient updates approximately equal. For example, when we train on 30% of the contracts, we",Legal Documents,,,
"consider grid search with the number of epochs in {3, 12} instead of {1, 4}.",Legal Documents,,,
We show the results in Figure 6. We notice a substantial increase in performance as the amount,Legal Documents,,,
"of training data increases. For example, increasing the amount of data by an order of magnitude",Legal Documents,,,
"increases performance from 27.6% to 42.6%, a 15% absolute difference.",Legal Documents,,,
"In fact, these gains in performance from just a single order of magnitude more data are comparable to",Legal Documents,,,
"the entire variation in performance across models. In particular, the best model (DeBERTa-xlarge)",Legal Documents,,,
has an AUPR that is 15.4% higher (in absolute terms) than that of the worst model in terms of AUPR.,Legal Documents,,,
"This indicates that data is a large bottleneck for contract review in this regime, highlighting the value",Legal Documents,,,
of CUAD.,Legal Documents,,,
5 Conclusion,Legal Documents,,,
We introduced a high-quality dataset of annotated contracts to facilitate research on contract review,Legal Documents,,,
and to better understand how well NLP models can perform in highly specialized domains. CUAD,Legal Documents,,,
"includes over 13,000 annotations by legal experts across 41 labels. We evaluated ten pretrained",Legal Documents,,,
language models on CUAD and found that performance is promising and has large room for im-,Legal Documents,,,
"provement. We found that data is a major bottleneck, as decreasing the amount of data by an order",Legal Documents,,,
"of magnitude cuts performance dramatically, highlighting the value of CUAD’s large number of",Legal Documents,,,
"annotations. We also showed that performance is markedly influenced by model design, suggesting",Legal Documents,,,
"that algorithmic improvements from the NLP community will help solve this challenge. Overall,",Legal Documents,,,
"CUAD can accelerate research towards resolving a major real-world problem, while also serving as a",Legal Documents,,,
benchmark for assessing NLP models on specialized domains more broadly.,Legal Documents,,,

"Social determinants of health are increasingly being recognized as important for individual, public and population health (Adler et al., 2016; Braveman & Gottlieb, 2014; Gottlieb et al., 2013). Civil legal issues are an important but often unrecognized social determinant of health. Civil legal issues can undermine housing, income, employment, family, health care and physical safety, creating adverse social and living conditions for the parties involved (Legal Services Corporation, 2007; Sandel et al., 2010). The vast majority of parties with civil legal issues in the United States use pro se representation – that is, they represent themselves instead of hiring professional legal representation. Unlike criminal courts where defendants are guaranteed an attorney if they cannot afford one, there is generally no right to an attorney for litigants in civil legal cases in the United States with a few exceptions such as the Right to Counsel movement in New York. Vulnerable populations, such as those in poverty or who have serious medical or mental health illnesses, have been found to have higher rates of civil legal issues and a greater incidence of negative consequences from these issues (Sandefur, 2015).",Legal Documents,,,
"The number of civil litigants choosing to self-represent in court has grown significantly in the past decade (Henschen, 2018; Landsman, 2009). However, many parties with civil legal issues lack knowledge about their rights and responsibilities, legal procedures and processes, and where and how to seek legal assistance (Kim, 1987; Teufel et al., 2015). Legal aid, defined as legal assistance provided to individuals who are unable to afford legal representation, is provided in communities across the country by public interest law firms and community legal clinics to the public free or at a reduced cost (Udell, 2016). Legal aid is a resource that many individuals rely on for assistance with their civil legal issues, and it can take many forms, from brief legal advice through a hotline, to in-person consultation, to full legal representation. Studies have shown that providing legal aid to individuals who need it can improve their health and well-being (O'Sullivan et al., 2012; Retkin et al., 2007; Ryan et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2017). In fact, legal scholars have begun to pay attention to the therapeutic or antitherapeutic effects of legal processes and procedures on the psychological outcomes of the parties involved, an interdisciplinary field called therapeutic jurisprudence (Wexler, 2008).",Legal Documents,,,
"However, legal aid offices throughout the country are understaffed, inundated with requests, and do not have the resources to fully attend to each case. The federally-funded Legal Services Corporation (LSC), which is the largest single funder of civil legal aid in the country, issued an important report in 2017 entitled ‘The Justice Gap’, which reported that 71% of low-income households experienced at least one civil legal problem in the past year, and 86% of civil legal problems reported by low-income Americans received inadequate or no legal help (Legal Service Corporation, 2017). In 2017, low-income Americans will approach LSC-funded legal aid organizations with an estimated 1.7 million problems but less than half of these problems will receive adequate legal help due to lack of resources (Legal Service Corporation, 2017).",Legal Documents,,,
"Legal empowerment is a growing concept that is being recognized by governments around the world and can be defined as the use of law to ethically strengthen disadvantaged populations and their control over their lives (Golub, 2010). A recent review of 90 studies reported on a wide range of legal empowerment interventions, such as increasing legal literacy, employing community-based paralegals and enacting right-to-information laws, but the authors concluded that there is need for more evidence-based practices (Goodwin & Maru, 2017).",Legal Documents,,,
"There have been various efforts to provide legal aid resources in different modalities. For example, law library resource centers include books and electronic resources, community-based paralegals, workshops, computer-based interactive forms and services co-located with court locations (American Bar Association, n.d.). There are also paid educational programs, free pro se legal clinics offered in many cities, and social media sites that offer assistance for pro se litigants (e.g. Facebook group, YouTube videos). There has been development of some online video games that teach individuals general information about the legal system (Hagan, 2017). However, we know of no previous development of video games that teach users specifically about the actual mechanics of pro se representation in civil legal proceedings – games that teach people the procedures of attending civil court without a lawyer.",Legal Documents,,,
"In the current study, we evaluated a pair of online video games called the RePresent games that offer gamified educational content on pro se representation and teach users about civil legal issues and procedures. The RePresent games were made available online to the general public in four U.S. states (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire). Using a quasi-experimental two-group design, we compared RePresent game users and a comparison group of non-game users on baseline characteristics and legal, mental health and psychosocial outcomes after 3 months. We hypothesized that RePresent gameplay would be associated with greater improvements in legal knowledge and mental health than in non-game users.",Legal Documents,,,
