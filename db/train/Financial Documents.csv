"Tesla's (TSLA.O), opens new tab margins are likely to drop in the third quarter and take a bigger hit in the last three months of 2023, leaving investors fretting about more price cuts needed to boost demand.
The electric automaker has given up some profitability to drive sales of its aging vehicle line-up in a high-interest rate environment and amid competition from China's BYD (002594.SZ), opens new tab, (1211.HK), opens new tab.
""I don't think the price cuts are over, mainly for the reason that demand is still weak,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Tesla shareholder Globalt Investments.
Here are the top five things to look out for in Tesla's earnings:
DELIVERIES TARGET
Investors will look for details on how CEO Elon Musk plans to ensure the company will deliver a record 476,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter to meet its annual goal of 1.8 million units.
Tesla has already cut U.S. prices of its Model 3 compact sedan and Model Y SUV in October. Last month it slashed prices of its premium S and X models and unveiled for some markets a restyled Model 3 with a longer driving range.
But Tesla is yet to start deliveries of the new Model 3 in China and Europe and has not yet given a timeline for its U.S. launch.

MARGINS
The price war - including cuts of more than 6% across models in the July-September period - likely pushed Tesla's margins to a four-year low of 18.1%, excluding regulatory credits, according to nine analysts polled by Visible Alpha.
The slump will continue into the fourth quarter and margins could dip below 15%, said Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan.
""We are factoring in help from the recent decline in lithium prices. However, that likely falls short of offsetting the price cuts,"" Langan said.

CYBERTRUCK
Tesla pushed its Cybertruck launch event to the end of the year from September. Musk has said the truck's design is hard to build.
The company had in 2019 projected a price of under $40,000 for the Cybertruck, but EV prices have risen since then.
""It will be around $49,900 for the single motor, probably $59,900 for the dual motor and probably $79,900 for the tri-motor, a little bit higher than Model Y,"" said Gary Black, managing partner of The Future Fund, which owns Tesla stock.
FULL-SELF DRIVING
Musk has long touted the potential of Tesla's full-self driving technology to boost Tesla's value. But the company has for years missed its targets to achieve the capability as the technology is under regulatory scrutiny over safety concerns.
Tesla slashed the technology's price by a fifth in August and analysts said that more cuts could be on the cards.
MEXICO FACTORY
Details including potential capital outlay is long awaited for a factory in Mexico's northern state of Nuevo Leon that Tesla announced in March.
A senior Mexican government official said last week that the facility's final permits could be ready in weeks and the local administration was starting infrastructure work Tesla requested.",Financial Statements
"NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles
Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods
presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in
conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on July 27, 2023.
We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no
impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated.
Estimates and Assumptions
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and
timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price of performance obligations, variable
consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or
potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible
assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates;
when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our
consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and
outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.

We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater
than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities
beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the
investment of cash that is available for current operations.
Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method.
Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based
on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we
evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is
less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative
evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we
have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair
value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.",Financial Statements

Recent Accounting Guidance
Segment Reporting – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new standard to improve reportable segment disclosures.
The guidance expands the disclosures required for reportable segments in our annual and interim consolidated financial statements, primarily
through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting
for fiscal year 2025 and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on
our segment disclosures.
Income Taxes – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
In December 2023, the FASB issued a new standard to improve income tax disclosures. The guidance requires disclosure of disaggregated
income taxes paid, prescribes standardized categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income
tax-related disclosures. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2026, with early adoption
permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our income tax disclosures.
NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential
common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock
options and stock awards.
The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:

Continuous improvement in Profitability
* For like-for-like comparisons, Mar-23 revenue and EBITDA in the above chart excludes ₹182 Cr UPI incentives received in that quarter
Key Financial Highlights:
§ Paytm reported revenue of ₹2,850 Cr, 38% YoY growth
§ Contribution profit up 45% YoY to ₹1,520 Cr (margin of 53%, up 2 percentage point YoY)
§ EBITDA before ESOP up ₹188 Cr YoY to ₹219 Cr (margin of 8%, up 6 percentage point YoY)
§ Profit after tax (PAT) improved by ₹170 Cr YoY to (₹222 Cr)
For Q3 FY 2024, Paytm reported 38% YoY revenue growth, due to accelerated GMV growth, higher device
addition, and growth of financial services business. This was partly boosted by the timing of festive seasons
(online sales for the festive season were in Q3, whereas in the previous financial year it was largely in Q2).
Net payment margin has gone up 63% YoY to ₹748 Cr due to increase in payment processing margin and
increase in merchant subscription revenues. Payment Processing Margin is in the 7-9bps range (no UPI
incentives booked during the quarter).
Financial services take rate has improved QoQ due to higher proportion of merchant loans and personal
loans distribution (Postpaid loans reduced QoQ as communicated in the December 6, 2023 update) and
increasing revenue from insurance distribution business. Average ticket size of merchant Loan and personal
will continue to increase further as proportion of high ticket loans continue to increase.
Contribution profit increased 45% YoY to ₹1,520 Cr, due to growth in net payment margin and financial
services business. On a QoQ basis, the contribution profits grew by 7%, but margin declined by 3
percentage points due to seasonal factors, such as higher promotions during festive season, higher
proportion of events business and slightly lower payment processing margins (in bps), typically experienced
during festive season. On back of growth and operating leverage, Q3 FY 2024 EBITDA before ESOP
increased by ₹188 Cr YoY to ₹219 Cr and PAT increased by ₹170 Cr YoY to (₹222 Cr)",Financial Statements
"Operational KPIs – Quarterly trends
Merchant payment network has large monetization opportunity
We continue to be a leading player in merchant
acquiring network. We see enhanced monetization
opportunities, such as:
1) Subscription revenue,
2) MDR on payments including products
on UPI rails like RuPay credit cards,
3) Government and RBI incentives such as UPI,
and PIDF
4) Merchant lending, and
5) Marketing services to merchants.

Earnings Release | Q3 FY 2024

Financial Services: Expanding distribution through High ticket
loans, Insurance distribution and Equity broking
Loan distribution business: In Q3 FY 2024, across our three loan distribution offerings (Merchant
Loans, Personal Loans, and Postpaid Loans), loans amounting to ₹15,535 Cr were distributed
through the Paytm platforms, up 56% YoY. The amount is 4% lower from last quarter as we have
and will continue to calibrate distribution of Postpaid loan on the back of the macro uncertainty
and regulatory guidance which was communicated on December 6, 2023. According to feedback
from our lending partners, asset quality of the loans distributed from our platform continues to
remain steady.
Paytm’s large and engaged consumer & merchant base continues to draw interest for lending
partnership. Recently we have added one more lending partner and one credit card partner. We are
in the process of integration with a couple of lending partners (Bank/NBFC) and one more credit
card partner. We have now partnered with 8 NBFCs for our loan distribution business and 3 Banks
for our credit card marketing business.
We are seeing good ramp-up in the high-ticket loan segment with a distribution of ₹490 Cr in the
quarter. With more than 2 Cr whitelist customers, we expect acceleration in this business as we
increase lending partners from 2 currently to at least 5-6 partners by Q1 FY 2025.
In addition to the existing loan distribution business, financial services distribution has two large
opportunities that are now meaningful: 1) Insurance distribution and 2) Equity broking and MF
distribution
Insurance distribution: We are building Insurance business by offering embedded insurance and
DIY products to Paytm consumers. There is special focus in leveraging merchant ecosystem by
offering them various business insurance solutions. Our platform offers contextually embedded
products that have Data-driven personalization and best-in-class claims experience by deeper
provider integrations.
Equity broking and MF distribution: Our equity broking and MF distribution continue to scale well
with organic traffic from Paytm app. Our focus is on retention of trading customers by offering high
quality trading platform and building MF distribution by leveraging SIPs.

".The same could be said for our international Stores expansion. In 2022, our international consumer segment
drove $118B of revenue. In our larger, established international consumer businesses, we’re big enough to
be impacted by the slowing macroeconomic conditions; however, the growth in 2019-2021 on a large base was
remarkable—30% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) in the UK, 26% in Germany, and 21% in
Japan (excluding the impact of FX). Over the past several years, we’ve invested in new international
geographies, including India, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, various European countries, the Middle East, and
parts of Africa. These new countries take a certain amount of fixed investment to get started and to scale, but
we like the trajectory they’re on, and their growth patterns resemble what we’ve seen in North America
and our established international geographies. Emerging countries sometimes lack some of the infrastructure
and services that our business relies on (e.g. payment methods, transportation services, and internet/
telecom infrastructure). To solve these challenges, we continue to work with various partners to deliver
solutions for customers. Ultimately, we believe that this investment in serving a broader geographical footprint
will allow us to help more customers across the world, as well as build a larger free cash flow-generating
consumer business.",Financial Statements

"Report of Independent Auditors
To the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the General Department of the International
Monetary Fund (the “Department”), which comprise the statements of financial position as of April 30,
2022 and 2021, and the related statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in reserves,
retained earnings, and resources, and of cash flows for the years then ended, including the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Department as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued
by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America (US GAAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit
of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the International
Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant
ethical requirements relating to our audit, which include relevant ethical requirements in the United
States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial
Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Department’s ability to
continue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting
period, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Department or to cease operations, or has
no realistic alternative but to do so.",Financial Statements

"impact of exogenous shocks, including heightened regional
or global stress conditions, access under a six-month PLL
arrangement is subject to a higher limit of 250 percent of
quota.
SLL arrangements have revolving access, and multiple
purchases and repurchases may take place during the
course of the arrangement, subject to a limit of 145 percent
of quota on the total credit outstanding at any given date
under current or any prior SLL arrangements.
Further, in September 2020, the IMF established policy
safeguards when a member requests financing with
combined access to GRA and Poverty Reduction and Growth
Trust (PRG Trust) resources in excess of specified
thresholds. These thresholds are set at the same levels that
trigger application of the GRA exceptional access framework.
The safeguards are also broadly aligned with the criteria and
procedures applied in the GRA exceptional access
framework described above. There were no limits on
combined access to GRA and PRG Trust resources prior to
September 2020.
The annual limit for RFI purchases is normally set at 50
percent of a member’s quota, with a cumulative limit of 100
percent of a member’s quota (net of scheduled repurchases).
These limits were temporarily increased to 100 percent of
quota annually and 150 percent of quota cumulatively (net of
scheduled repurchases) for the period from April 6, 2020,
through June 30, 2023.
Purchases under SBA and EFF arrangements are made in
tranches and are subject to conditionality in the form of
performance criteria, indicative targets, structural
benchmarks, and prior actions, as well as regular reviews by
the Executive Board.
In addition, the IMF has adopted a safeguards policy to
mitigate the risk of misuse of resources and a misreporting
policy to deal with incorrect reporting of data or performance
against any conditions under an IMF-supported program.
Safeguards assessments of member central banks are
undertaken to provide the IMF with reasonable assurance
that the central bank’s legal structure, governance, control,
reporting, and auditing systems are adequate to maintain the
integrity of its operations and to manage resources, including
IMF disbursements. When IMF resources are provided as
direct budget financing to the government, the safeguards
policy also requires that IMF disbursements be deposited at
the central bank, and that an appropriate framework
agreement between the central bank and the government be
in place to ensure timely servicing of the member’s financial
obligations to the IMF. Further, a fiscal safeguards review of
the state treasury is required for cases where a member
requests exceptional access, and at least 25 percent of IMF
funds are expected to be used for direct budget financing.
The maximum credit risk exposure is the carrying value of
the IMF’s credit outstanding and undrawn commitments.
4.2.1.1 Credit outstanding

SDR 89,788 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively

region was as follows:
The use of credit in the GRA by the largest users was as
follows:
The five largest users of GRA credit at April 30, 2022, and
2021, in descending order, were Argentina, Egypt, Ukraine,
Pakistan, and Ecuador. Credit outstanding by member is
presented in Schedule 1.
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number
of countries have benefited from emergency financial
assistance under the RFI (see Note 5.1), including 21
countries with a total disbursed amount of SDR 9,480 million
that did not have credit outstanding from the IMF at March
31, 2020. There is no ex-post program-based conditionality
or reviews under the RFI, with overall conditionality limited.
4.2.1.2 Undrawn commitments
Undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements amounted
to SDR 102,614 million and SDR 93,457 million at April 30,
2022, and 2021, respectively. Commitments and undrawn
balances unde",Financial Statements
"No purchases under RFIs had been approved by the
Executive Board, but not yet disbursed at April 30, 2022
(SDR 630 million at April 30, 2021).
The undrawn commitments under GRA arrangements have
also increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (see
Note 1.5) as the IMF has approved new financial assistance
under its lending arrangements (including to four countries
that had not had a lending arrangement with, or credit
outstanding to the IMF at March 31, 2020) and augmented
existing lending arrangements to accommodate urgent new
needs arising from the impact of the pandemic.
4.2.2 Market risk on financial assets and liabilities other than
investments
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows
of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in
market prices. Market risk for financial assets and liabilities
other than investments includes interest rate risk and
exchange rate risk.
4.2.2.1 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that future net cash flows will
fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. All
interest-bearing financial instruments other than investments
of the General Department accrue interest either at the SDR
interest rate or at a rate that is linked to the SDR interest rate
(see Note 2.2). Interest rate risk is primarily managed by
linking the rate of charge directly, by means of a fixed
margin, to the cost of financing (which is equal to the SDR
interest rate).
4.2.2.2 Exchange rate risk
Exchange rate risk is the risk that the General Department’s
financial position and cash flows will be affected by
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
 The General Department has no exchange rate risk
exposure on its holdings of members’ currencies in the
GRA because members maintain the value of such
holdings in SDR terms (see Note 5).
 The General Department has other assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than SDRs and makes
administrative payments largely in US dollars, but the
exchange rate risk exposure associated with these
activities is limited.
 The General Department has no exchange rate exposure
from its current borrowing arrangements because all
drawings are denominated in SDRs.
4.2.3 Liquidity risk on financial assets and liabilities other
than investments
Liquidity risk is the risk to the General Department of
nonavailability of resources to meet the financing needs of
members and its own obligations. The IMF must have usable
resources available to meet members’ demand for IMF
financing. While the IMF’s resources are largely of a
revolving nature, uncertainties in the timing and amount of
credit extended to members during financial crises expose
the IMF to liquidity risk. Moreover, the IMF must also stand
ready to provide resources for unexpected needs, for
example, to: (i) meet, upon a member’s representation of
need, potential demands for a drawing on the member’s
reserve tranche; and (ii) authorize drawings to meet
demands for encashment of creditor claims under the New
Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) or the bilateral borrowing
agreements (see Note 14).
The IMF manages its liquidity risk by closely scrutinizing
developments in its liquidity position. The IMF’s main liquidity
measure—Forward Commitment Capacity-represents the
IMF’s capacity to make new GRA resources available to its
members over the following 12 months (see Schedule 2).
Long-term liquidity needs are addressed by reviewing the
adequacy of quota-based resources. General reviews of
members’ quotas are conducted at regular intervals to
evaluate the adequacy of quota-based resources to meet
members’ demand for IMF financing. The IMF may also
borrow to supplement its quota resources (see Note 14).
Short-term liquidity needs for financing activities are reviewed
and approved by the Executive Board on a periodic basis
through a financial transactions plan for quota resources and
the resource mobilization plan for borrowed resources.
4.2.3.1 Maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities other
than investments
Depending on the type of financing instrument, repurchase
periods for GRA credit vary from 3¼ to 10 years. Scheduled
and overdue repurchases of outstanding GRA credit are
summarized below:
Repayments of outstanding borrowings are determined
according to the schedule of repurchases of credit that was
financed by borrowed resources. They also take into account
the maximum maturity of outstanding borrowings, which was",Financial Statements
"equal to 10 years for all outstanding borrowings. Scheduled
repayments of outstanding borrowings are summarized
below:
Repurchases during the financial years ended April 30, 2022,
and 2021, included advance repurchases of
SDR 3,797 million and SDR 3,677 million, respectively.
These advance repurchases resulted in earlier than
scheduled repayments of outstanding borrowings of
SDR 1,134 million and SDR 2,094 million, respectively.
Future interest payments on borrowings calculated at the
SDR interest rate at April 30, 2022, represent SDR 10 million
for the financial year ending April 30, 2023. Thereafter, a total
of SDR 3 million will be paid through the last repayment date.
Usable and other currencies, SDR holdings, and quota
subscriptions do not have maturity dates.
4.3 Investments
Investments are exposed to credit, market, and liquidity risks.
4.3.1 Credit risk on investments
Credit risk on investments represents the potential loss if
issuers and counterparties were to default on their
contractual obligations.
Credit risk in the IA is minimized by limiting fixed-income
investments to financial instruments with a credit rating at the
time of acquisition:
 For the Fixed-Income Subaccount, effective January 12,
2022 the minimum credit rating is set at the equivalent of
BBB– (based on Standard & Poor’s long-term rating scale)
for corporate bonds and BBB+ for all other assets (at least
A for all assets before January 12, 2022).
 For the Endowment Subaccount, the minimum credit
rating is set at BBB+ for sovereign bonds and BBB– for
corporate bonds and private infrastructure debt. Limited
holdings in the Endowment Subaccount of corporate
bonds and private infrastructure debt rated below BBB–
are permitted under the Rules and Regulations of the
Investment Account.
 Exempt from the credit rating requirement are instruments
issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),
which does not have a credit rating, central bank deposits,
and short-term instruments.
The carrying amount of the fixed-income instruments
represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The credit
risk exposure for fixed-income instruments in the IA, at the
end of the respective reporting periods, was as follows:
Fixed-Income Subaccount
April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021
(as a percentage of total investments in
fixed-income instruments)
Not rated (BIS) — 0.0% 2,557 15.6%
AAA 5,422 29.3% 5,918 36.2%
AA+ to AA– 7,075 38.3% 3,435 21.0%
A+ to A 5,741 31.1% 4,305 26.4%
BBB+ 240 1.3% 125 0.8%
Total 18,478 100.0% 16,340 100.0%
Counterparty risk for derivative instruments is mitigated by
strict exposure limits, credit rating requirements, and
collateral requirements. The maximum exposure to credit risk
for derivative instruments is the amount of any unrealized
gains on such contracts.
The credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the
Fixed-Income Subaccount amounted to SDR 106 million and
SDR 38 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The
credit risk exposure for derivative instruments in the
Endowment Subaccount amounted to SDR 58 million and
SDR 5 million at April 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
4.3.2 Market risk on investments
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows
of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in
market prices. Market risk for investments includes interest
rate risk, exchange rate risk, and other price risks.
The investment objectives of the Fixed-Income and
Endowment Subaccounts differ, and the investment
strategies, including asset allocation and risk tolerance, are
tailored for each of the subaccounts, thereby exposing them
to different types of market risk",Financial Statements
"4.3.2.1 Fixed-Income Subaccount
The Fixed-Income Subaccount holds debt obligations of a
broad range of issuers within limits defined by the Rules and
Regulations of the IA (see Note 7.1 for the eligible
investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class
diversification and within asset classes through broad
security selection.
The Fixed-Income Subaccount authorizes the use of
derivative instruments for managing interest rate risk,
currency hedging, or reducing costs in the context of portfolio
balancing, benchmark replication, and market access.
Safeguards are in place against short selling and financial
leverage.
Exchange rate risk is mitigated by hedging investments
denominated in non-SDR currencies into SDR basket
currencies with the objective of preserving the Fixed-Income
Subaccount’s SDR basket composition.
4.3.2.2 Endowment Subaccount
Investments are divided into eight categories, which are
subject to varying market risks and benefits from
diversification properties (see Note 7.2 for the eligible
investments). Market risk is mitigated through asset class
diversification and within asset classes through broad
security selection.
Effective January 12, 2022, except for the allocation to
emerging market equities, which may be managed actively,
all Endowment Subaccount assets shall be managed
passively (prior to January 12, 2022, the Endowment
Subaccount was split into the passively-managed portfolio
managed in accordance with the strategic asset allocation
and the actively-managed portfolio, which could comprise up
to 10 percent of the Endowment assets, invested in the same
asset categories with target shares for fixed-income
instruments and equities without specific allocation
requirements within those shares).
The Endowment Subaccount authorizes the use of derivative
instruments for managing interest rate risk, currency hedging,
or reducing costs in the context of portfolio balancing,
benchmark replication, and market access.
Because the IMF’s administrative expenditures are largely in
US dollars and the Endowment Subaccount’s general
objective is to contribute to covering such expenditures (see
Note 1.2), the performance of the Endowment Subaccount is
measured in US dollars as the base currency but translated
into SDRs for financial reporting. The Rules and Regulations
of the IA provide for hedging against the exchange rate risk
for fixed-income instruments denominated in developed
market currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar. The valuation
changes from exchange rate fluctuations are included in the
determination of investment income.
4.3.2.3 Value at risk
Exposures to market risk, including interest rate, exchange
rate, and other price risks, are measured using VaR, which
considers known market risks in each of the asset categories
and the effect of asset class diversification. VaR estimates
reported below represent the maximum potential loss in
value of the assets over the next year due to adverse market
movements with a 95 percent confidence level. There is a
1 in 20 chance that annual losses on investment assets are
equal to or exceed the reported VaR. Losses in a single year
could exceed the reported VaR by a significant amount.
The VaR model is based on historical simulations with a
three-year look back period and monthly overlapping risk
factor returns for each individual instrument in the portfolios
to produce plausible future scenarios based on these
simulations. In each simulation scenario, risk factor data on
the valuation date is shocked according to past observations
and each instrument is repriced, resulting in a hypothetical
empirical distribution of returns. There is no standard
methodology for estimating VaR, and the modeling of the
market risk characteristics of the investments involves many
assumptions and some limited proxy or substitutes. Different
assumptions or methodologies would produce significantly
different VaR estimates.
The VaR for the Fixed-Income Subaccount portfolio was as
follows:
April 30, 2022 April 30, 2021
(in millions of SDRs)
Tranche 1 (see Note 7) 169 65

1 Following the changes to the investment strategy approved by the Executive
Board on January 12, 2022, the investment categories of developed market
sovereign bonds and emerging market bonds were restructured into the global
sovereign bonds category.
4.3.3 Liquidity risk on investments
Liquidity risk on investments refers to the risk that an
investment will not have an active buyer or seller when
traded, which could negatively affect the price of the
investment.
The IA’s liquidity needs are low and the liquidity risk is
minimal because both subaccounts hold the majority of their
resources in readily marketable short-term investments.
4.3.3.1 Maturity profile of investments

Investments in both subaccounts largely represent liquid
investments, which could be sold earlier than their maturity,
whenever necessary.
4.4 Post-employment benefit plans
The General Department is exposed to investment, liquidity,
and longevity risks associated with post-employment benefit
plans (the Plans). These risks are balanced against the need
to meet the financial obligations of each plan. The Plans
have adopted general guidelines on permissible investments
and plan assets are invested according to a strategic asset
allocation, which is expected to generate a rate of return at or
in excess of the rate of growth in the Plans’ liabilities. The
strategic asset allocation is reviewed periodically by the
Investment Committee. The strategic asset allocation is
designed to minimize the level of portfolio market risk
(volatility) for the targeted rate of return, while better aligning
portfolio volatility with the potential volatility of the Plans’
liabilities. Through a global, multiple-asset-class investment
approach, the portfolio risk is reduced for any targeted rate of
return, because asset class returns are not perfectly
correlated as regional and global economic, financial, and
political events unfold. The Plans do not utilize specific,
targeted asset-liability matching instruments or strategies",Financial Statements

5.1.1 Emergency financial assistance
The tables above reflect emergency financing under the RFI
that was provided by the General Department to members
facing urgent balance of payments needs as a result of the
economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit
outstanding by member is presented in Schedule 1.
Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the access
limits for RFI purchases were temporarily increased (see
Note 4.2.1).
5.1.2 Impairment analysis
The General Department has performed an impairment
analysis of credit outstanding in accordance with its ECL
model (see Note 3.2.1.1). Based on this analysis, no loss
allowance was deemed to be necessary at April 30, 2022,
and 2021. As described in Note 3.2.1.1, the impairment
analysis of the General Department’s credit outstanding
takes into account the unique nature of the IMF’s financing
and its institutional status, and is performed holistically for
each debtor member based on qualitative and quantitative
considerations and taking into account relevant current
developments, including the geopolitical and global economic
developments as described in Note 1.5. In this context, the
results of the impairment analysis at April 30, 2022, and
2021, are not materially sensitive to reasonable changes in
input parameters of the ECL calculation.
5.2 Overdue obligations
At April 30, 2022, no member was six months or more
overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General
Department (one member—Sudan—was six months or more
overdue in settling its financial obligations to the General
Department at April 30, 2021).
On June 29, 2021, Sudan settled all of its overdue
obligations to the General Department, including GRA credit
outstanding and overdue charges of SDR 142 million and
SDR 738 million, respectively. Settlement of the overdue
charges generated burden-sharing refunds to members
totaling SDR 611 million that had been previously collected
through burden-sharing adjustments to charges and
remuneration (see Notes 13.1, 13.2, 17, and 18).
6. SDR holdings
The General Department can receive SDRs from members in
the settlement of their financial obligations to the GRA and
quota subscription payments. In addition, the GRA may use
or receive SDRs in transactions and operations with
members, including the provision of financial assistance to
members, the receipt of charges and fees, and the payment
of remuneration on reserve tranche positions or interest on
borrowings to member countries and lenders.
At April 30, 2022, and 2021, the SDR holdings of the General
Department amounted to SDR 22,270 million and
SDR 22,203 million, respectively.
The GRA earns interest on its SDR holdings at the same rate
as other holders of SDRs. Interest on SDR holdings during
the financial years ended April 30, 2022, and 2021,
amounted to SDR 25 million and SDR 17 million,

8. Fair value measurement
Valuation techniques used to value financial instruments
include the following:
Level 1
The fair value of publicly traded investments is based on
quoted market prices in an active market for identical assets
without any adjustments (closing price for equities and
derivative instruments and bid price for fixed-income
securities). These investments are included within Level 1 of
the fair value hierarchy.
Level 2
The fair value of equity and fixed-income securities not
actively traded is determined on the basis of a compilation of
significant observable market information, such as recently
executed trades in securities of the issuer or comparable
issuers and yield curves. The assessment also takes into
account the inherent risk and terms and conditions of each
security. Given that the significant inputs are observable,
these securities are included within Level 2 of the fair value
hierarchy.
The fair value of over-the-counter derivative instruments
(foreign exchange forwards, currency/interest rate swaps) not
actively traded is determined using a pricing model that
incorporates foreign exchange spot and forward rates and
interest rate curves. Given that the significant inputs into the
pricing models are market observable, these instruments are
included within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Level 3
The private infrastructure debt assets classified within Level
3 have significant unobservable inputs, as they trade
infrequently or do not trade at all. As observable prices are
not available for these assets, the mark-to-model valuation
technique is used to derive the fair value. Different
assumptions or approximations could produce significantly
different valuation estimates.

totaling SDR 11 million in the Endowment Subaccount were
transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 (there were no transfers

These investments relate to equity securities where trading
was either inactive or quoted prices in the applicable market
were not observable as at April 30, 2022. Quoted prices for
similar securities directly observable in an alternative market
were used for fair value measurement of these securities as
at April 30, 2022. During the financial year ended April 30,
2021, there were no transfers from level 1 to level 2 in both
the Fixed-Income and Endowment Subaccounts.

"Report of Independent Auditors
To the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund
Opinions
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRG
Trust), the Trust for Special Poverty Reduction and Growth Operations for the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries and Interim ECF Subsidy Operations and related Umbrella Account for HIPC Operations (the
PRG-HIPC Trust and related Umbrella Account), and the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust and
the related Umbrella Account for CCR Operations (CCR Trust and related Umbrella Account) (hereafter
collectively referred to as the “Concessional Lending and Debt Relief Trusts” or the “Trusts”), which
comprise the statements of financial position as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of
comprehensive income and changes in resources and of cash flows for the years then ended, including the
related notes (collectively referred to as the “ financial statements”).
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of each of the Trusts as of April 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of each of their operations and
each of their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America (US GAAS) and in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit
of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Trusts and the
International Monetary Fund, and have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the
relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits, which include relevant ethical requirements in the
United States of America and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial
Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Trusts’ ability to
continue as a going concern for at least, but not limited to, twelve months from the end of the reporting
period, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Trusts or to cease operations, or has no
realistic alternative but to do so.",Financial Statements
