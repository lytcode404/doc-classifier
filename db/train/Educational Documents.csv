"This section of the Journal of Business Ethics Education is a forum for authors
to present, explain and reflect on their use of teaching and learning materials
with students of business ethics. We welcome material from teachers,
lecturers, professors and trainers working in any business ethics context from
university philosophy programmes through to corporate training
environments. In this respect, it is intended as a place for sharing our practice
as a community of educators and making more public how we go about the
business of teaching business ethics.
Firstly, we are looking for contributors to present a wide variety of
educational materials. Reflecting the pedagogic tradition of business and
management education, “case studies” are also, perhaps, the dominant tool for
teaching and learning in business ethics. In this first issue of the Journal, Craig
Smith from the London Business School presents a detailed case study analysis
of the “rise and fall” of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. This case was
one of the most high profile scandals of recent years and has important
implications for students of accountancy, in particular. In submitting materials
to the Journal, we would wish to encourage case studies of all types presenting
examples of organisational role models (eg Weber, 1995) as well as corporate
fiascos; placing learners in a range of stakeholder roles (in addition to
executive or middle management employees); and focusing on different
organisational forms and attendant purposes (corporate and unincorporated;
private and public sector; profit and non-profit making).
While we welcome original and contemporary case study submissions to
this section, the editors would like to encourage contributors to submit
examples of materials which illustrate other ways in which they facilitate
student learning. Examples might include notes on the use of a video case
study (eg Hosmer, 1997); the use of simulations, such as a role play
(Macfarlane and Ottewill, 2001) or computer generated model (eg Schumann,
Anderson and Scott, 1997); web discussion boards (eg Spence and
Wadsworth, 2002); service-learning projects (eg Friedman, 1996); the use of
fiction (eg Shephard, Goldsby and Gerde, 1997) and popular movies (eg",Educational Materials,
"88 Introduction to Education Materials
Berger and Pratt, 1998; Van Es, 2003); together with experiential methods,
more generally (eg Sanyal, 2000). While there is now a small but growing
literature focusing on varied teaching and learning methods and materials there
have been surprisingly few papers discussing how we should assess student
learning in business ethics. Hence, in submitting educational materials
contributors should, wherever appropriate, give details of alternative forms of
assessment in business ethics such as multiple choice questionnaires, reflective
learning logs or business reports in addition to discussion or essay-type
questions.
Secondly, in submitting to this section, contributors are asked to write a
teaching note to guide and explain to others how they might make best use of
their educational materials. In other words, there is a need for an explanation
of the aims or purposes of an activity or assessment, a discussion of the role of
the teacher(s) and the students and also, perhaps, practical advice on matters
such as room lay-out and the associated use of learning resources. Craig
Smith’s teaching note in respect of the Arthur Andersen case study contains a
list of educational objectives, a guide to the technical complexities of the case,
anticipated student responses to key questions, advice on how to structure
discussion, pointers to where the experience of learners might be drawn out
and ways of linking the case with ethical theory. As such, it provides an
excellent guide to a complex case. The question which follows on naturally
from how to use educational materials is .how would you teach it next time?.
Here we are asking for a degree of candour about the successes and problems
which teachers face in the process of deploying their own material. Hence our
suggestion is for authors to reflect critically on their experiences in using their
own teaching materials. The work of Donald Schon (1983) has proven to be
highly influential for many professional and business educators both in
seeking to embed the principles of reflective practice among our own students
and learning from this principle ourselves. In this regard it is important that we
practice what many of us preach in reflecting critically on our work as teachers.
In this reflective process, the teacher’s own thoughts can be usefully
supplemented by inclusion of the student “voice”, and other relevant
stakeholders from business and the wider community, in the evaluation
process.
It should be noted that the Journal is particularly interested in
disseminating examples of practice that encourage active learning through
student participation as opposed to a passive transmission of knowledge.
Hence, the educational materials section is intended as much more than a place
to simply find examples of downloaded teaching materials. It is about how to
deploy such materials successfully drawing on the experience and reflections
of teachers. We hope that contributors and general readers alike will find this
section of the Journal both useful in providing readily useable educa",Educational Materials,
"RODUCTION One important dimension in teacher education that is getting a lot of attention is related to the use of instructional materials. Instructional materials are those materials used by a teacher to simplify their teaching. They include both visual and audio-visual aids and could either be concrete or non-concrete. These instructional materials bring life to learning by stimulating students to learn. The use of instructional materials in the classroom has the potential to help the teacher explain new concepts clearly, resulting in better student understanding of the concepts being taught. However, they are not ends in themselves but they are means to an end (Kadzera, 2006). It is held that good teaching resources can never replace the teacher but the teacher uses them to achieve their teaching and learning objectives. Some of the instructional materials necessary for effective teaching and learning of Social Studies include the chalkboard, models, graphs, charts, maps, pictures, diagrams, cartoons, slides, filmstrips, radio, and television (Kochhar, 1991). The importance of the use of these materials cannot be underscored. This has been emphasized by a number of scholars. Lockheed (1991) says that instructional materials are critical ingredients in learning and that the curriculum could not be easily implemented without them. Kochhar (1991) adds that a teacher who has adequate and relevant teaching facilities is more confident, effective and productive. Similar sentiments are shared by Steel (1983) who asserts that relevant instructional materials enable the learners to have a clear understanding of Conflict and Conflict Resolution. Instructional materials are essential since they help the teacher and learners avoid overemphasis on recitation and rote learning that can easily dominate a lesson. Resource materials allow learners to have practical experiences which help them to develop skills and concepts and to work in a variety of ways. The work of Sampath (1990) graphically explain that people learn more through the senses of sight and hearing compared to other senses. International Journal of Education and Practice, 2015, 3(6): 224-234 © 2015 Pak Publishing Group. All Rights Reserved. 226 Table-1. Percentages of what is learnt using Different Senses Senses used when Learning % of what is learnt Taste 1.0 Touch 1.5 Small 3.5 Hearing 11.5 Sight 83.0 Total 100.0 Source: Sampath (1990) Sampath also notes that we remember more when we see, hear, say and do. Table-2. What is remembered from Learning Activities using Different Senses Learning Activity % of what is remembered What we read 10 What we hear 20 What we see 30 What we see and hear 50 What we say and do 80 Source: Sampath (1990) The implication here is that for more knowledge to be internalized, more of the learner’s senses have to be stimulated other than hearing alone. In learning and teaching, the various senses can be stimulated through the use of audiovisual materials. In teaching Conflict and Conflict Resolution, the Non-Violence Education Programme asserts that the flip chart teaching tool is a stand-alone material that can be used in any classroom without the expense of additional resource. At the same time, Walkin (1982) says that instructional materials have to meet the learning objectives, be validated and their impact be evaluated. But Jarolimek and Parker (1993) are of the view that instructional materials for Social Studies need to be evaluated carefully before, during and after they have been used. This is because it is the teacher and not the media who produce exciting programmes for children. As such, apart from being available and adequate, instructional materials should also be used appropriately. No material is entirely self-teaching; they all require a teacher to set the stage for learning to take place because materials of instruction can be no better than the teachers who use them. In summary, Romiszowski (1988); Walkin (1982) and Hills (1982) concur on the fact that if instructional materials are properly selected and used, the following would occur:  Learning would be interesting and meaningful.  Knowledge acquired would be retained for a longer time.  Different skills would be acquired by learners.  Students would be actively involved during lessons. From the above views, it is clear that instructional materials are essential for effective teaching of Conflict and Conflict Resolution in Social Studies and should be made adequately available in all schools. To help teachers become better teachers, most schools in developed countries are provided with a variety of instructional materials and equipment. But the situation in Primary International Journal of Education and Practice, 2015, 3(6): 224-234 © 2015 Pak Publishing Group. All Rights Reserved. 227 schools in Kenya is quite different. The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) carried out a summative evaluation of the 8-4-4 in the secondary school curriculum. It emerged that if learning materials were to be used effectively, then there was need for provision of adequate resources and facilities. Teaching materials needed for inquiry methods are sometimes non-existent and relatively expensive when available. Ogoma (1987) in a survey on resources for teaching in Nairobi primary schools, has found that teachers are not eager to use the available instructional materials or even produce them. Komen (1991) in a similar study in Baringo District, found out that instructional materials are inadequate. Similarly, Malakwen (2000) on teacher trainers and trainees’ attitudes towards the implementation of Social Studies curriculum in Kenya’s Teacher education institutions, noted that the materials that trainees use in preparation for teaching practice in primary schools are inadequate and of low quality. Most of these studies on the teaching of Social Studies were carried out before the introduction of the new Social Studies Syllabus in 2002. In the new syllabus, emerging issues like Conflict and Conflict Resolution have been introduced. For these topics to be effectively taught there is need to adequately avail and effectively utilize instructional materials. This paper, therefore, assesses the availability and use of instructional materials by Social Studies teachers in primary schools in Kenya in teaching Conflict and Conflict Resolution. 2. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM There have been increasing criticisms on the teaching of Social Studies in primary schools in Kenya, especially with regard to the teaching methods and instructional materials. The teaching of Social Studies in Kenyan classrooms has been dominated by lecturing and giving of notes, accompanied by use of the chalkboard only and prescribed textbooks (African Social and Environmental Studies Programme (African Social and Environmental Studies Programme, 1993). One of the emerging issues included for teaching and learning in the Social Studies syllabus in the Kenyan primary schools is Conflict and Conflict Resolution. The objective of teaching this topic is to enable the learners to understand the factors that cause disputes and demonstrate the ability and readiness to amicably resolve their own disputes in and out of schools (Kenya Institute of Education, 2002). For this learning objective to be achieved the teacher must select the instructional procedures and materials that will enable the leaner to internalize, retain and apply what has been learnt. Only then can the learners productively apply what they learn in everyday life. Ogoma (1987) in a study on resources for teaching in Nairobi primary schools, points out that teachers are not eager to use the available resources. Moreover, Komen (1991) observes that instructional materials are inadequate and at the same time, teachers are not adequately prepared. It was against this background that the study was carried out to investigate the teaching of the topic on Conflict and Conflict Resolution in Social Studies in primary schools in Nandi North District in Kenya.

LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY Since the sample subjects were few, the results may not be generalized to other areas. Nevertheless, the research findings reveal a lot about the current state of teaching methods and materials for teaching Conflict and Conflict Resolution in Social Studies and the attitude of teachers towards these. Moreover, Kosirai Division was in a rural setting hence the findings obtained may not apply to schools in peri-urban and urban setting. Another limitation had to do with the fact that since the topic is taught once a year in Class Seven, the researchers had to inform the teachers in advance about the observation of the lesson. As such, they may have",Educational Materials,
"4. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was carried out in Kosirai Division, which is part of Nandi North District, in the formerly Rift Valley Province, Kenya. Kosirai is a rich agricultural region where crops like maize, potatoes and vegetables are grown. Dairy farming is also widely practiced. It covers an area of 3,784 km2 . The Division has three (3) educational zones, namely Mutwot, Lelmokwo, and Kosirai. Educational institutions include forty-five (45) primary schools, twelve (12) secondary schools, one (1) college and other tertiary institutions such as village polytechnics. The research design adopted for the study was a descriptive survey. This kind of research was chosen because it would help reveal answers to questions concerning the current status of the teaching of Conflict and Conflict Resolution in Social Studies at the primary school level with regard to instructional methods and materials and the attitudes of teachers towards instructional methods and materials for teaching the topic. It was assumed the findings from the research would apply to other primary schools in Kenya because the same Social Studies syllabus is used in the whole country and the teachers of Social Studies in primary schools in Kenya are trained on how to use different instructional procedures and materials. The target population consisted of primary school Social Studies teachers in Kosirai Division. The teachers were distributed in primary schools across three educational zones in the Division namely, a) Mutwot zone with sixteen (16) schools, b) Lelmokwo zone with fourteen (14) schools and c) Kosirai zone with fifteen (15) schools. The sample for the study was drawn from all the Standard Seven Social Studies teachers in Kosirai Division. One teacher was picked from each of the 45 schools. Purposive sampling was used to ensure that subjects were picked from Class Seven Social Studies teachers since they are the ones who do the actual teaching of Conflict and Conflict Resolution in class. Most of the schools in the Division had one stream of Standard Seven thus the teacher was automatically selected. Therefore, 45 teachers who taught social studies in class seven in primary schools in Kosirai Division were used for the study. The instruments used for data collection in the study were: a questionnaire, document analysis and classroom observation checklist. After receiving the completed questionnaires, the author went through all of them to ensure that there were no mistakes in the marking of responses. Open-ended items were categorized and coded. An item-by-item analysis of the data was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) computer program where frequencies and International Journal of Education and Practice, 2015, 3(6): 224-234 © 2015 Pak Publishing Group. All Rights Reserved. 229 percentages were computed. The analyzed data was presented by use of tables and discussed in relation to the research questions and the reviewed literature so as to draw conclusions and make recommendations. Information from the teachers’ guides was entered into a document analysis checklist. These were computed to get frequencies and percentages and the results presented in tables. Information from classroom observation checklists was coded and the data was analyzed where frequencies and percentages were computed and also presented in tables",Educational Materials,
"esolution The study sought to establish the available instructional materials for teaching and learning of Social Studies topics such as Conflict and Conflict Resolution. The results were as shown in Table 3 below. Table-3.

All of the teachers, 40(100%), agreed that teachers’ and pupils’ textbooks, the chalkboard, wall maps, atlases and teacher-made notes were available. The findings further revealed that newspapers were available, according to a low percentage of teachers; 16(40%) agreed and 24(60%) disagreed on this. Inadequate availability of the requisite material may have hindered effective preparation and teaching of Conflict and Conflict Resolution in Social Studies. Conflicts are a part of everyday living. Newspapers update one on conflicts as and how they occur and how they have or have not been resolved. News on conflicts in parts of the country, continent and beyond could guide the teacher when preparing to teach the lesson.",Educational Materials,
"Regarding charts, 36(90%) indicated that they were available while 4(10%) said they were not available. In contrast, for audio tapes 2(5%) agreed while 38(95%) disagreed that they were available. The absence of these resources could be attributed to the lack of electricity in most rural schools. This may have made the learners miss out on the development of listening skills as well as bringing reality into the lesson thus making the content applicable to their lives. Jacinta and Regina (1992) assert that audio tapes bring reality into the classroom and add interest and enjoyment to the lesson. The school radio was available to 8(20%) of the teachers while 32(80%) said they did not have it. Pupils should be exposed to radio lessons since they are tailored to provide perfect learning based on thorough preparation by KIE standards (Jacinta and Regina, 1992). Pictures were available to 28(70%) while 12(30%) gave a negative response. Magazines could be accessed by 6(15%) which was a small number compared to 34(85%) who could not access them. This implied that the teachers concentrated only on the approved textbooks in their preparation and teaching which may not have provided all the information for effective teaching of conflict and conflict Resolution. The findings also revealed that the television and the computer were available to only a handful 2(5%) while 38(95%) had no access to them. This may be explained by the fact that because of the rural setting, there was no electricity in most schools as earlier stated thus these gadgets could not be used. The teachers seemed to be keen on preparation for their lessons as 38(95%) agreed to teacher made-notes. A small percentage, 2(5%), did not have teacher-made notes and thus may have depended on textbooks only. Schools were generally ill-equipped with the instructional materials needed for effective teaching of Conflict and Conflict Resolution.",Educational Materials,

All Rights Reserved. 231 All the respondents, 40(100%), indicated that they always used pupils’ textbooks and the chalkboard. This implied that the teachers made use of materials that were available as earlier indicated in Table 3.Regarding teachers’ references, 38(95%) indicated that they always used them while 2(5%) used them occasionally. On wall maps, 6(15%) indicated they used them always, 32(80%) indicated that they used them occasionally while 2(5%) never used them. With regard to Atlases, 14(35%) indicated they used them always, 24(60%) said frequently and 2(5%) never used them. As the results in Table 4 show, 22(55%) indicated that they used newspapers always, 18(45%) said frequently. This implies that though newspapers may not have been available to some of them, 24(60%), as earlier shown in Table 3, they made an effort to access them for purposes of teaching Conflict and Conflict Resolution. Newspapers should be made available to all teachers in primary schools because from these newspapers they could link what they are teaching to everyday life. The findings further indicated that 8(20%) of the respondents always used charts, 30(75%) used them frequently and 2(5%) never used charts. Majority, 38(95%), of the respondents indicated that they never used audio tapes while 4(10%) frequently used audio tapes. Regarding the school radio, none of them used it always, 6(15%) used it frequently and 34(85%) never used it. With regard to pictures, 12(30%) indicated that they used them always, 18(45%) frequently while 10(25%) never used pictures at all. This is not in keeping with the fact that one learns 83.0% through sight (Sampath, 1990). Pupils taught by the 10(25%) respondents were therefore disadvantaged. When asked to state the frequency of use of magazines, 0(0%) indicated that they used them always, 8(20%) used them frequently and 30(75%) never used them. This may be because they were not available to many of the respondents, 34(85%), as earlier indicated in Table 3; or they may have not been sensitized on the use of magazines in teaching conflict and conflict resolution. The study further revealed that none of the respondents used the television 0(0%). According to Sampath (1990) one remembers 50% of what they learn through sight and hearing. Learners should, therefore, be exposed to different teaching materials. Table-5.

"The Harappan seal (Fig.1.1) is possibly the most
distinctive artefact of the Harappan or Indus valley
civilisation. Made of a stone called steatite, seals
like this one often contain animal motifs and signs
from a script that remains undeciphered. Yet we
know a great deal about the lives of the people who
lived in the region from what they left behind –
their houses, pots, ornaments, tools and seals – in
other words, from archaeological evidence. Let us
see what we know about the Harappan civilisation,
and how we know about it. We will explore how
archaeological material is interpreted and how
interpretations sometimes change. Of course, there
are some aspects of the civilisation that are as yet
unknown and may even remain so.
Terms, places, times
The Indus valley civilisation is also called the Harappan culture.
Archaeologists use the term “culture” for a group of objects,
distinctive in style, that are usually found together within a specific
geographical area and period of time. In the case of the Harappan
culture, these distinctive objects include seals, beads, weights, stone
blades (Fig. 1.2) and even baked bricks. These objects were found
from areas as far apart as Afghanistan, Jammu, Baluchistan
(Pakistan) and Gujarat (Map 1).
Named after Harappa, the first site where this unique culture
was discovered (p. 6), the civilisation is dated between c. 2600 and
1900 BCE. There were earlier and later cultures, often called Early
Harappan and Late Harappan, in the same area. The Harappan
civilisation is sometimes called the Mature Harappan culture to
distinguish it from these cultures.

1. Beginnings
There were several archaeological cultures in the
region prior to the Mature Harappan. These cultures
were associated with distinctive pottery, evidence of
agriculture and pastoralism, and some crafts.
Settlements were generally small, and there were
virtually no large buildings. It appears that there
was a break between the Early Harappan and the
Harappan civilisation, evident from large-scale
burning at some sites, as well as the abandonment
of certain settlements.
2. Subsistence Strategies
If you look at Maps 1 and 2 you will notice that the
Mature Harappan culture developed in some of the
areas occupied by the Early Harappan cultures.
These cultures also shared certain common elements
including subsistence strategies. The Harappans ate
a wide range of plant and animal products, including
fish. Archaeologists have been able to reconstruct
dietary practices from finds of charred grains and
seeds. These are studied by archaeo-botanists, who
are specialists in ancient plant remains. Grains

found at Harappan sites include
wheat, barley, lentil, chickpea
and sesame. Millets are found
from sites in Gujarat. Finds of
rice are relatively rare.
Animal bones found at Harappan
sites include those of cattle, sheep,
goat, buffalo and pig. Studies
done by archaeo-zoologists or zooarchaeologists indicate that these
animals were domesticated.
Bones of wild species such as
boar, deer and gharial are
also found. We do not know
whether the Harappans hunted
these animals themselves or
obtained meat from other hunting
communities. Bones of fish and
fowl are also found.
2.1 Agricultural technologies
While the prevalence of
agriculture is indicated by finds
of grain, it is more difficult to
reconstruct actual agricultural practices. Were
seeds broadcast (scattered) on ploughed lands?
Representations on seals and terracotta sculpture
indicate that the bull was known, and
archaeologists extrapolate from this that oxen
were used for ploughing. Moreover, terracotta
models of the plough have been found at sites in
Cholistan and at Banawali (Haryana).
Archaeologists have also found evidence of a
ploughed field at Kalibangan (Rajasthan),
associated with Early Harappan levels (see p. 20).
The field had two sets of furrows at right angles to
each other, suggesting that two different crops
were grown together.
Archaeologists have also tried to identify the
tools used for harvesting. Did the Harappans use
stone blades set in wooden handles or did they use
metal tools?
Most Harappan sites are located in semi-arid
lands, where irrigation was probably required for
agriculture. Traces of canals have been found at
the Harappan site of Shortughai in Afghanistan, but
not in Punjab or Sind. It is possible that ancient

canals silted up long ago. It is also likely that water
drawn from wells was used for irrigation. Besides,
water reservoirs found in Dholavira (Gujarat) may
have been used to store water for agriculture.
How artefacts are identified
Processing of food required grinding equipment as well as vessels
for mixing, blending and cooking. These were made of stone, metal
and terracotta. This is an excerpt from one of the earliest reports on
excavations at Mohenjodaro, the best-known Harappan site:
Saddle querns … are found in considerable numbers
… and they seem to have been the only means in use
for grinding cereals. As a rule, they were roughly made
of hard, gritty, igneous rock or sandstone and mostly
show signs of hard usage. As their bases are usually
convex, they must have been set in the earth or in
mud to prevent their rocking. Two main types have
been found: those on which another smaller stone was
pushed or rolled to and fro, and others with which a
second stone was used as a pounder, eventually
making a large cavity in the nether stone. Querns of
the former type were probably used solely for grain;
the second type possibly only for pounding herbs and
spices for making curries. In fact, stones of this latter
type are dubbed “curry stones” by our workmen and
our cook asked for the loan of one from the museum
for use in the kitchen.

different from the Citadel?
3. Mohenjodaro
A Planned Urban Centre
Perhaps the most unique feature of the Harappan
civilisation was the development of urban centres.
Let us look at one such centre, Mohenjodaro,
more closely. Although Mohenjodaro is the most
well-known site, the first site to be discovered
was Harappa.
The settlement is divided into two sections, one
smaller but higher and the other much larger but

6 THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY
The plight of Harappa
Although Harappa was the
first site to be discovered, it
was badly destroyed by brick
robbers. As early as 1875,
Alexander Cunningham, the
first Director-General of the
Archaeological Survey of
India (ASI), often called the
father of Indian archaeology,
noted that the amount
of brick taken from the
ancient site was enough
to lay bricks for “about
100 miles” of the railway
line between L ahore and
Multan. Thus, many of the
ancient structures at the site
were damaged. In contrast,
Mohenjodaro was far better
preserved.
lower. Archaeologists designate these as the Citadel
and the Lower Town respectively. The Citadel owes
its height to the fact that buildings were constructed
on mud brick platforms. It was walled, which
meant that it was physically separated from the
Lower Town.
The Lower Town was also walled. Several buildings
were built on platforms, which served as foundations.
It has been calculated that if one labourer moved
roughly a cubic metre of earth daily, just to put the
foundations in place it would have required four
million person-days, in other words, mobilising
labour on a very large scale.
Consider something else. Once the platforms were
in place, all building activity within the city was
restricted to a fixed area on the platforms. So it
seems that the settlement was first planned and
then implemented accordingly. Other signs of
planning include bricks, which, whether sun-dried
or baked, were of a standardised ratio, where the
length and breadth were four times and twice the
height respectively. Such bricks were used at all
Harappan settlements.
3.1 Laying out drains
One of the most distinctive features of Harappan
cities was the carefully planned drainage system. If
you look at the plan of the Lower Town you will notice
that roads and streets were laid out along an
approximate “grid” pattern, intersecting at right
angles. It seems that streets with drains were laid
out first and then houses built along them. If
domestic waste water had to flow into the street
drains, every house needed to have at least one wall
along a street.
Citadels
While most Harappan settlements have a small high
western part and a larger lower eastern section, there
are variations. At sites such as Dholavira and Lothal
(Gujarat), the entire settlement was fortified, and
sections within the town were also separated by walls.
The Citadel within Lothal was not walled off, but was
built at a height.
Fig. 1.8

drain.

3.2 Domestic architecture
The Lower Town at Mohenjodaro provides examples
of residential buildings. Many were centred on a
courtyard, with rooms on all sides. The courtyard
was probably the centre of activities such as cooking
and weaving, particularly during hot and dry
weather. What is also interesting is an apparent
concern for privacy: there are no windows in the
walls along the ground level. Besides, the main
entrance does not give a direct view of the interior
or the courtyard.
Every house had its own bathroom paved with
bricks, with drains connected through the wall to
the street drains. Some houses have remains of
staircases to reach a second storey or the roof. Many
houses had wells, often in a room that could be
reached from the outside and perhaps used by
passers-by. Scholars have estimated that the total
number of wells in Mohenjodaro was about 700.
The most ancient
system yet discovered
About the drains, Mackay
noted: “It is certainly the most
complete ancient system as yet
discovered.” Every house was
connected to the street drains.
The main channels were made
of bricks set in mortar and were
covered with loose bricks that
could be removed for cleaning.
In some cases, limestone was
used for the covers. House
drains first emptied into a sump
or cesspit into which solid
matter settled while waste water
flowed out into the street drains.
Very long drainage channels
were provided at intervals with
sumps for cleaning. It is a
wonder of archaeology that
“little heaps of material, mostly
sand, have frequently been
found lying alongside drainage
channels, which shows … that
the debris was not always
carted away when the drain
was cleared”.
FROM ERNEST MACKAY, Early Indus
Civilisation, 1948.
Drainage systems were not
unique to the larger cities,
but were found in smaller
settlements as well. At Lothal
for example, while houses were
built of mud bricks, drains were
made of burnt bricks.

8 THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY
3.3 The Citadel
It is on the Citadel that we
find evidence of structures
that were probably used for
special public purposes.
These include the warehouse
– a massive structure of
which the lower brick
portions remain, while the
upper portions, probably
of wood, decayed long
ago – and the Great Bath.
The Great Bath was a
large rectangular tank in a
courtyard surrounded by a
corridor on all four sides.
There were two flights of
steps on the north and
south leading into the tank,
which was made watertight
by setting bricks on edge
and using a mortar of
gypsum. There were rooms
on three sides, in one of
which was a large well.
Water from the tank flowed
into a huge drain. Across a
lane to the north lay a
smaller building with
eight bathrooms, four on
each side of a corridor,
with drains from each
bathroom connecting to a
drain that ran along the
corridor. The uniqueness of
the structure, as well as
the context in which it
was found (the Citadel,
with several distinctive
buildings), has led scholars
to suggest that it was meant for some kind of a special
ritual bath.

4. Tracking Social Differences
4.1 Burials
Archaeologists generally use certain strategies to
find out whether there were social or economic
differences amongst people living within a particular
culture. These include studying burials. You are
probably familiar with the massive pyramids of
Egypt, some of which were contemporaneous with
the Harappan civilisation. Many of these pyramids
were royal burials, where enormous quantities of
wealth was buried.
At burials in Harappan sites the dead were
generally laid in pits. Sometimes, there were
differences in the way the burial pit was made – in
some instances, the hollowed-out spaces were lined
with bricks. Could these variations be an indication
of social differences? We are not sure.
Some graves contain pottery and ornaments,
perhaps indicating a belief that these could be used
in the afterlife. Jewellery has been found in burials
of both men and women. In fact, in the excavations
at the cemetery in Harappa in the mid-1980s, an
ornament consisting of three shell rings, a jasper
(a kind of semi-precious stone) bead and hundreds
of micro beads was found near the skull of a male.
In some instances the dead were buried with copper
mirrors. But on the whole, it appears that the
Harappans did not believe in burying precious things
with the dead.
4.2 Looking for “luxuries”
Another strategy to identify social differences is to
study artefacts, which archaeologists broadly
classify as utilitarian and luxuries. The first category
includes objects of daily use made fairly easily out
of ordinary materials such as stone or clay. These
include querns, pottery, needles, flesh-rubbers (body
scrubbers), etc., and are usually found distributed
throughout settlements. Archaeologists assume
objects were luxuries if they are rare or made from
costly, non-local materials or with complicated
technologies. Thus, little pots of faience (a material
made of ground sand or silica mixed with colour
and a gum and then fired) were probably considered
precious because they were difficult to make.
The situation becomes more complicated
when we find what seem to be articles of daily
Fig. 1.11

BRICKS, BEADS AND BONES
Fig. 1.12
A faience pot
2019-20
10 THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY
use, such as spindle whorls made of rare materials
such as faience. Do we classify these as utilitarian
or luxuries?
If we study the distribution of such artefacts, we
find that rare objects made of valuable materials
are generally concentrated in large settlements like
Mohenjodaro and Harappa and are rarely found in
the smaller settlements. For example, miniature pots
of faience, perhaps used as perfume bottles, are found
mostly in Mohenjodaro and Harappa, and there are
none from small settlements like Kalibangan. Gold
too was rare, and as at present, probably precious –
all the gold jewellery found at Harappan sites was
recovered from hoards.
5. Finding Out About Craft
Production
Locate Chanhudaro on Map 1. This is a tiny
settlement (less than 7 hectares) as compared to
Mohenjodaro (125 hectares), almost exclusively
devoted to craft production, including bead-making,
shell-cutting, metal-working, seal-making and
weight-making.
The variety of materials used to make beads is
remarkable: stones like carnelian (of a beautiful red
colour), jasper, crystal, quartz and steatite; metals
like copper, bronze and gold; and shell, faience and
terracotta or burnt clay. Some beads were made of
two or more stones, cemented together, some of stone
with gold caps. The shapes were numerous – discshaped, cylindrical, spherical, barrel-shaped,
segmented. Some were decorated by incising or
painting, and some had designs etched onto them.
Ü Discuss...
What are the modes of
disposal of the dead prevalent
at present? To what extent do
these represent social
differences?
Hoards are objects kept
carefully by people, often inside
containers such as pots. Such
hoards can be of jewellery or
metal objects saved for reuse
by metalworkers. If for some
reason the original owners do
not retrieve them, they remain
where they are left till some
archaeologist finds them.
Fig. 1.13
A tool and beads
2019-20
11
Techniques for making beads differed according
to the material. Steatite, a very soft stone, was easily
worked. Some beads were moulded out of a paste
made with steatite powder. This permitted making a
variety of shapes, unlike the geometrical forms made
out of harder stones. How the steatite micro bead
was made remains a puzzle for archaeologists
studying ancient technology.
Archaeologists’ experiments have revealed that the
red colour of carnelian was obtained by firing the
yellowish raw material and beads at various stages
of production. Nodules were chipped into rough
shapes, and then finely flaked into the final form.
Grinding, polishing and drilling completed the
process. Specialised drills have been found at
Chanhudaro, Lothal and more recently at Dholavira.
If you locate Nageshwar and Balakot on Map 1,
you will notice that both settlements are near the
coast. These were specialised centres for making
shell objects – including bangles, ladles and
inlay – which were taken to other settlements.
Similarly, it is likely that finished products (such
as beads) from Chanhudaro and Lothal were taken
to the large urban centres such as Mohenjodaro
and Harappa.
5.1 Identifying centres
 of production
In order to identify centres
of craft production,
archaeologists usually look
for the following: raw
material such as stone
nodules, whole shells, copper
ore; tools; unfinished
objects; rejects and waste
material. In fact, waste is
one of the best indicators
of craft work. For instance,
if shell or stone is cut to
make objects, then pieces
of these materials will be
discarded as waste at the
place of production.
Fig. 1.14
Pottery
Some of these can be seen in the
National Museum, Delhi or in the
site museum at Lothal.
Ü Discuss...
Should the stone artefacts
illustrated in the chapter be
considered as utilitarian
objects or as luxuries? Are
there any that may fall into
both categories?
BRICKS, BEADS AND BONES
Fig. 1.15
A terracotta figurine
2019-20
12 THEMES IN INDIAN HISTORY
Sometimes, larger waste pieces were used up to
make smaller objects, but minuscule bits were
usually left in the work area. These traces suggest
that apart from small, specialised centres, craft
production was also undertaken in large cities such
as Mohenjodaro and Harappa.
6. Strategies for Procuring
Materials
As is obvious, a variety of materials was used for
craft production. While some such as clay were
locally available, many such as stone, timber and
metal had to be procured from outside the alluvial
plain. Terracotta toy models of bullock carts suggest
that this was one important means of transporting
goods and people across land routes. Riverine routes
along the Indus and its tributaries, as well as coastal
routes were also probably used.
6.1 Materials from the subcontinent and beyond
The Harappans procured materials for craft
production in various ways. For instance, they
established settlements such as Nageshwar and
Balakot in areas where shell was available. Other
such sites were Shortughai, in far-off Afghanistan,
near the best source of lapis lazuli, a blue stone
that was apparently very highly valued, and Lothal
which was near sources of carnelian (from Bharuch
in Gujarat), steatite (from south Rajasthan and north
Gujarat) and metal (from Rajasthan).
Another strategy for procuring raw materials may
have been to send expeditions to areas such as the
Khetri region of Rajasthan (for copper) and south
India (for gold). These expeditions established
communication with local communities. Occasional
finds of Harappan artefacts such as steatite micro
beads in these areas are indications of such contact.
There is evidence in the Khetri area for what
archaeologists call the Ganeshwar-Jodhpura culture,
with its distinctive non-Harappan pottery and
an unusual wealth of copper objects. It is possible
that the inhabitants of this region supplied copper
to the Harappans.
Fig.1.16
Copper and bronze vessels
2019-20

6.2 Contact with distant lands
Recent archaeological finds suggest that copper was
also probably brought from Oman, on the southeastern tip of the Arabian peninsula. Chemical
analyses have shown that both the Omani copper
and Harappan artefacts have traces of nickel,
suggesting a common origin. There are other traces
of contact as well. A distinctive type of vessel, a
large Harappan jar coated with a thick layer of black
clay has been found at Omani sites. Such thick
coatings prevent the percolation of liquids. We do
not know what was carried in these vessels, but it
is possible that the Harappans exchanged the
contents of these vessels for Omani copper.
Mesopotamian texts datable to the third
millennium BCE refer to copper coming from
a region called Magan, perhaps a name for
Oman, and interestingly enough copper found at

Other archaeological
finds suggestive of longdistance contacts include
Harappan seals, weights,
dice and beads. In this
context, it is worth noting
that Mesopotamian texts
mention contact with regions named Dilmun
(probably the island of Bahrain), Magan and
Meluhha, possibly the Harappan region. They
mention the products from Meluhha: carnelian,
lapis lazuli, copper, gold, and varieties of wood.
A Mesopotamian myth says of Meluhha: “May your
bird be the haja-bird, may its call be heard in
the royal palace.” Some archaeologists think the
haja-bird was the peacock. Did it get this name
from its call? It is likely that
communication with Oman,
Bahrain or Mesopotamia was
by sea. Mesopotamian texts
refer to Meluhha as a
land of seafarers. Besides,
we find depictions of ships
and boats on seals.

7. Seals, Script, Weights
7.1 Seals and sealings
Seals and sealings were used to facilitate longdistance communication. Imagine a bag of goods
being sent from one place to another. Its mouth was
tied with rope and on the knot was affixed some wet
clay on which one or more seals were pressed,
leaving an impression. If the bag reached with
its sealing intact, it meant that it had not been
tampered with. The sealing also conveyed the identity
of the sender.
7.2 An enigmatic script
Harappan seals usually have a line of writing,
probably containing the name and title of the owner.
Scholars have also suggested that the motif
(generally an animal) conveyed a meaning to those
who could not read.
Most inscriptions are short, the longest containing
about 26 signs. Although the script remains
undeciphered to date, it was evidently not
alphabetical (where each sign stands for a vowel or
a consonant) as it has just too many signs –
somewhere between 375 and 400. It is apparent that
the script was written from right to left as some
seals show a wider spacing on the right and cramping
on the left, as if the engraver began working from
the right and then ran out of space.
Consider the variety of objects on which writing
has been found: seals, copper tools, rims of jars,
copper and terracotta tablets, jewellery, bone rods,
even an ancient signboard! Remember, there may
have been writing on perishable materials too. Could
this mean that literacy was widespread?
7.3 Weights
Exchanges were regulated by a precise system of
weights, usually made of a stone called chert and
generally cubical (Fig. 1.2), with no markings. The

lower denominations of weights were binary (1, 2, 4,
8, 16, 32, etc. up to 12,800), while the higher
denominations followed the decimal system. The
smaller weights were probably used for weighing
jewellery and beads. Metal scale-pans have also
been found.
8. Ancient Authority
There are indications of complex decisions being
taken and implemented in Harappan society. Take
for instance, the extraordinary uniformity of
Harappan artefacts as evident in pottery (Fig. 1.14),
seals, weights and bricks. Notably, bricks, though
obviously not produced in any single centre, were of
a uniform ratio throughout the region, from Jammu
to Gujarat. We have also seen that settlements were
strategically set up in specific locations for various
reasons. Besides, labour was mobilised for making
bricks and for the construction of massive walls
and platforms.
Who organised these activities?
8.1 Palaces and kings
If we look for a centre of power or for depictions of
people in power, archaeological records provide no
immediate answers. A large building found at
Mohenjodaro was labelled as a palace by
archaeologists but no spectacular finds were
associated with it. A stone statue was labelled and
continues to be known as the “priest-king”. This is
because archaeologists were familiar with
Mesopotamian history and its “priest-kings” and have
found parallels in the Indus region. But as we will
see (p.23), the ritual practices of the Harappan
civilisation are not well understood yet nor are there
any means of knowing whether those who performed
them also held political power.
Some archaeologists are of the opinion that
Harappan society had no rulers, and that everybody
enjoyed equal status. Others feel there was no single
ruler but several, that Mohenjodaro had a separate
ruler, Harappa another, and so forth. Yet others
argue that there was a single state, given the
similarity in artefacts, the evidence for planned
settlements, the standardised ratio of brick size, and
the establishment of settlements near sources of raw

material. As of now, the last theory seems the most
plausible, as it is unlikely that entire communities
could have collectively made and implemented such
complex decisions.
9. The End of the Civilisation
There is evidence that by c. 1800 BCE most of the Mature
Harappan sites in regions such as Cholistan had been
abandoned. Simultaneously, there was
an expansion of population into new
settlements in Gujarat, Haryana and
western Uttar Pradesh.
In the few Harappan sites that
continued to be occupied after 1900
BCE there appears to have been a
transformation of material culture,
marked by the disappearance of the
distinctive artefacts of the civilisation
– weights, seals, special beads.
Writing, long-distance trade, and
craft specialisation also disappeared.
In general, far fewer materials were
used to make far fewer things. House
construction techniques deteriorated
and large public structures were no
longer produced. Overall, artefacts
and settlements indicate a rural way
of life in what are called “Late
Harappan” or “successor cultures”.
What brought about these
changes? Several explanations have
been put forward. These range from
climatic change, deforestation,
excessive floods, the shifting and/or drying up of
rivers, to overuse of the landscape. Some of these
“causes” may hold for certain settlements, but they
do not explain the collapse of the entire civilisation.
It appears that a strong unifying element, perhaps
the Harappan state, came to an end. This is
evidenced by the disappearance of seals, the script,
distinctive beads and pottery, the shift from a
standardised weight system to the use of local
weights; and the decline and abandonment of cities.
The subcontinent would have to wait for over a
millennium for new cities to develop in a completely
different region.

"All of us have the experience of seeing a spark or hearing a crackle when we take off our synthetic clothes or sweater, particularly in dry weather. Have you ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another common example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the sky during thunderstorms. We also experience a sensation of an electric shock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a bus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is discharge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated due to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that this is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we are going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything that does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with the study of forces, fields and potentials arising from static charges. 1.2 ELECTRIC CHARGE Historically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with wool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece, around 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word Rationalised 2023-24 2 Physics elektron meaning amber. Many such pairs of materials were known which on rubbing could attract light objects like straw, pith balls and bits of papers. It was observed that if two glass rods rubbed with wool or silk cloth are brought close to each other, they repel each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The two strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods were rubbed, also repel each other. However, the glass rod and wool attracted each other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat’s fur repelled each other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other hand, the plastic rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool with which the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur. These seemingly simple facts were established from years of efforts and careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many careful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of an entry which is called the electric charge. We say that the bodies like glass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire an electric charge on rubbing. There are two kinds of electrification and we find that (i) like charges repel and (ii) unlike charges attract each other. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is called the polarity of charge. When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of charge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for any pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified glass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they no longer attract each other. They also do not attract or repel other light objects as they did on being electrified. Thus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged bodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these observations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects neutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were named as positive and negative by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin. By convention, the charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and that on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an electric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge it is said to be electrically neutral. FIGURE 1.1 Rods: like charges repel and unlike charges attract each other. Rationalised 2023-24 Electric Charges and Fields 3 A simple apparatus to detect charge on a body is the gold-leaf electroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a box, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged object touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to the leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of the amount of charge. Try to understand why material bodies acquire charge. You know that all matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally the materials are electrically neutral, they do contain charges; but their charges are exactly balanced. Forces that hold the molecules together, forces that hold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associated with surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from the forces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive and it encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is therefore essential that we learn more about such a force. To electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of charge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this excess charge or deficit of charge. In solids, some of the electrons, being less tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred from one body to the other. A body can thus be charged positively by losing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively by gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the electrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets positively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is created in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are transferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the material body. 1.3 CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS Some substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others do not. Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily are called conductors. They have electric charges (electrons) that are comparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal bodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass, porcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of electricity through them. They are called insulators. Most substances fall into one of the two classes stated above*. When some charge is transferred to a conductor, it readily gets distributed over the entire surface of the conductor. In contrast, if some charge is put on an insulator, it stays at the same place. You will learn why this happens in the next chapter. This property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb gets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article * There is a third category called semiconductors, which offer resistance to the movement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and insulators. Rationalised 2023-24 4 Physics like spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through our body to the ground as both are conductors of electricity. However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic handle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows signs of charging. 1.4 BASIC PROPERTIES OF ELECTRIC CHARGE We have seen that there are two types of charges, namely positive and negative and their effects tend to cancel each other. Here, we shall now describe some other properties of the electric charge. If the sizes of charged bodies are very small as compared to the distances between them, we treat them as point charges. All the charge content of the body is assumed to be concentrated at one point in space. 1.4.1 Additivity of charges We have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a charge; we shall follow it up in the next section. We shall tentatively assume that this can be done and proceed. If a system contains two point charges q1 and q2 , the total charge of the system is obtained simply by adding algebraically q1 and q2 , i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they are scalars like the mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q1 , q2 , q3 , …, qn , then the total charge of the system is q1 + q2 + q3 + … + qn . Charge has magnitude but no direction, similar to mass. However, there is one difference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is always positive whereas a charge can be either positive or negative. Proper signs have to be used while adding the charges in a system. For example, the total charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3, +4 and –5, in some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 in the same unit. 1.4.2 Charge is conserved We have already hinted to the fact that when bodies are charged by rubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new charges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric charge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When we rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses. Within an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to interactions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is found that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved. Conservation of charge has been established experimentally. It is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated system although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyed FIGURE 1.2 Electroscopes: (a) The gold leaf electroscope, (b) Schematics of a simple electroscope. Rationalised 2023-24 Electric Charges and Fields 5 in a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns into a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus created have equal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after the creation. 1.4.3 Quantisation of charge Experimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples of a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always given by q = ne where n is any integer, positive or negative. This basic unit of charge is the charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge on an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is written as –e and that on a proton as +e. The fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e is termed as quantisation of charge. There are a large number of situations in physics where certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge was first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by English experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by Millikan in 1912. In the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a coulomb and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms the unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a subsequent chapter. In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge flowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 1 of Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the basic unit of charge is e = 1.602192 × 10–19 C Thus, there are about 6 × 1018 electrons in a charge of –1C. In electrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom encountered and hence we use smaller units 1 mC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC (milli coulomb) = 10–3 C. If the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the universe, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e. Thus, if a body contains n1 electrons and n2 protons, the total amount of charge on the body is n2 × e + n1 × (–e) = (n2 – n1 ) e. Since n1 and n2 are integers, their difference is also an integer. Thus the charge on any body is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased or decreased also in steps of e. The step size e is, however, very small because at the macroscopic level, we deal with charges of a few mC. At this scale the fact that charge of a body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect, the grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous. This situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points and lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to us but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to Rationalised 2023-24 6 Physics EXAMPLE 1.2 EXAMPLE 1.1 each other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many small charges taken together appear as a continuous charge distribution. At the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous compared to the magnitude of charge e. Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge of magnituOde, say 1 mC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic charge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in units of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous values. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no practical consequence and can be ignored. However, at the microscopic level, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds of e, i.e., they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and quantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale involved that is very important. Example 1.1 If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body every second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C on the other body? Solution In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore the charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C. The time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated to be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10–10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365 × 24 × 3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb, from a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will need approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large unit for many practical purposes. It is, however, also important to know what is roughly the number of electrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material. A cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 1024 electrons. Example 1.2 How much positive and negative charge is there in a cup of water? Solution Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is 250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole (= 6.02 × 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of molecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 . Each molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and total negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 × 10 × 1.6 × 10–19 C = 1.34 × 107 C. 1.5 COULOMB’S LAW Coulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two point charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller than the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the charged bodies are treated as point charges. Coulomb measured the force between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as the square of the distance between the charges and was directly proportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and Rationalised 2023-24 Electric Charges and Fields 7 acted along the line joining the two charges. Thus, if two point charges q1 , q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum, the magnitude of the force (F) between them is given by 1 2 2 q q F k r = (1.1) How did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments? Coulomb used a torsion balance* for measuring the force between two charged metallic spheres. When the separation between two spheres is much larger than the radius of each sphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges. However, the charges on the spheres were unknown, to begin with. How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)? Coulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the charge on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact with an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread over the two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each sphere will be q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get charges q/2, q/4, etc. Coulomb varied the distance for a fixed pair of charges and measured the force for different separations. He then varied the charges in pairs, keeping the distance fixed for each pair. Comparing forces for different pairs of charges at different distances, Coulomb arrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1). Coulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement, was initially experimentally arrived at in the manner described above. While the original experiments established it at a macroscopic scale, it has also been established down to subatomic level (r ~ 10–10 m). Coulomb discovered his law without knowing the explicit magnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other way round: Coulomb’s law can now be employed to furnish a definition for a unit of charge. In the relation, Eq. (1.1), k is so far arbitrary. We can choose any positive value of k. The choice of k determines the size of the unit of charge. In SI units, the value of k is about 9 × 109 2 2 Nm C . The unit of charge that results from this choice is called a coulomb which we defined earlier in Section 1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we see that for q1 = q2 = 1 C, r = 1 m F = 9 × 109 N That is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a distance of 1 m from another charge of the same magnitude in vacuum experiences an electrical force of repulsion of magnitude * A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later by Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two objects, to verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation. * Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation: two charges (q/2 each) add up to make a total charge q. Charles Augustin de Coulomb (1736 – 1806) Coulomb, a French physicist, began his career as a military engineer in the West Indies. In 1776, he returned to Paris and retired to a small estate to do his scientific research. He invented a torsion balance to measure the quantity of a force and used it for determination of forces of electric attraction or repulsion between small charged spheres. He thus arrived in 1785 at the inverse square law relation, now known as Coulomb’s law. The law had been anticipated by Priestley and also by Cavendish earlier, though Cavendish never published his results. Coulomb also found the inverse square law of force between unlike and like magnetic poles. CHARLES AUGUSTIN DE COULOMB (1736 –1806) Rationalised 2023-24 8 Physics 9 × 109 N. One coulomb is evidently too big a unit to be used. In practice, in electrostatics, one uses smaller units like 1 mC or 1 mC. The constant k in Eq. (1.1) is usually put as k = 1/4pe0 for later convenience, so that Coulomb’s law is written as 0 1 2 2 1 4 q q F ε r = π (1.2) e 0 is called the permittivity of free space . The value of e 0 in SI units is 0  = 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1m–2 Since force is a vector, it is better to write Coulomb’s law in the vector notation. Let the position vectors of charges q1 and q2 be r1 and r2 respectively [see Fig.1.3(a)]. We denote force on q1 due to q2 by F12 and force on q2 due to q1 by F21. The two point charges q1 and q2 have been numbered 1 and 2 for convenience and the vector leading from 1 to 2 is denoted by r21: r21 = r2 – r1 In the same way, the vector leading from 2 to 1 is denoted by r12: r12 = r1 – r2 = – r21 The magnitude of the vectors r21 and r12 is denoted by r 21 and r 12 , respectively (r 12 = r21). The direction of a vector is specified by a unit vector along the vector. To denote the direction from 1 to 2 (or from 2 to 1), we define the unit vectors: ɵ 21 21 21 = r r r , ɵ 12 ɵ ɵ 12 21 12 12 = − , r r r r r Coulomb’s force law between two point charges q1 and q2 located at r1 and r2 , respectively is then expressed as 1 2 ɵ 21 21 2 21 1 4 ε = π F r o q q r (1.3) Some remarks on Eq. (1.3) are relevant: · Equation (1.3) is valid for any sign of q1 and q2 whether positive or negative. If q1 and q2 are of the same sign (either both positive or both negative), F21 is along rˆ 21, which denotes repulsion, as it should be for like charges. If q1 and q2 are of opposite signs, F21 is along – ɵr 21(= ɵr 12), which denotes attraction, as expected for unlike charges. Thus, we do not have to write separate equations for the cases of like and unlike charges. Equation (1.3) takes care of both cases correctly [Fig. 1.3(b)]. FIGURE 1.3 (a) Geometry and (b) Forces between charges.

(1.3)] gives the force between two charges q1 and q2 in vacuum. If the charges are placed in matter or the intervening space has matter, the situation gets complicated due to the presence of charged constituents of matter. We shall consider electrostatics in matter in the next chapter. Example 1.3 Coulomb’s law for electrostatic force between two point charges and Newton’s law for gravitational force between two stationary point masses, both have inverse-square dependence on the distance between the charges and masses respectively. (a) Compare the strength of these forces by determining the ratio of their magnitudes (i) for an electron and a proton and (ii) for two protons. (b) Estimate the accelerations of electron and proton due to the electrical force of their mutual attraction when they are 1 Å (= 10-10 m) apart? (mp = 1.67 × 10–27 kg, me = 9.11 × 10–31 kg) Solution (a) (i) The electric force between an electron and a proton at a distance r apart is: 2 2 0 1 4 e e F ε r = − π where the negative sign indicates that the force is attractive. The corresponding gravitational force (always attractive) is: 2 p e G m m F G r = − where mp and me are the masses of a proton and an electron respectively. 2 39 0 2.4 10 4 e G p e F e F Gm m ε = = × π (ii) On similar lines, the ratio of the magnitudes of electric force to the gravitational force between two protons at a distance r apart is: F F e Gm m e G p p = = 2 4π 0 ε 1.3 × 1036 However, it may be mentioned here that the signs of the two forces are different. For two protons, the gravitational force is attractive in nature and the Coulomb force is repulsive. The actual values of these forces between two protons inside a nucleus (distance between two protons is ~ 10-15 m inside a nucleus) are Fe ~ 230 N, whereas, FG ~ 1.9 × 10–34 N. The (dimensionless) ratio of the two forces shows that electrical forces are enormously stronger than the gravitational forces. Rationalised 2023-24 10 Physics (b) The electric force F exerted by a proton on an electron is same in magnitude to the force exerted by an electron on a proton; however, the masses of an electron and a proton are different.

The value for acceleration of the proton is 2.3 × 10–8 N / 1.67 × 10–27 kg = 1.4 × 1019 m/s",Educational Materials,
"Electrochemistry is the study of production of electricity from energy released during spontaneous chemical reactions and the use of electrical energy to bring about non-spontaneous chemical transformations. The subject is of importance both for theoretical and practical considerations. A large number of metals, sodium hydroxide, chlorine, fluorine and many other chemicals are produced by electrochemical methods. Batteries and fuel cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy and are used on a large scale in various instruments and devices. The reactions carried out electrochemically can be energy efficient and less polluting. Therefore, study of electrochemistry is important for creating new technologies that are ecofriendly. The transmission of sensory signals through cells to brain and vice versa and communication between the cells are known to have electrochemical origin. Electrochemistry, is therefore, a very vast and interdisciplinary subject. In this Unit, we will cover only some of its important elementary aspects. After studying this Unit, you will be able to · describe an electrochemical cell and differentiate between galvanic and electrolytic cells; · apply Nernst equation for calculating the emf of galvanic cell and define standard potential of the cell; · derive relation between standard potential of the cell, Gibbs energy of cell reaction and its equilibrium constant; · define resistivity (r), conductivity (k) and molar conductivity (✆m ) of ionic solutions; · differentiate between ionic (electrolytic) and electronic conductivity; · describe the method for measurement of conductivity of electrolytic solutions and calculation of their molar conductivity; · justify the variation of conductivity and molar conductivity of solutions with change in their concentration and define m (molar conductivity at zero concentration or infinite dilution); · enunciate Kohlrausch law and learn its applications; · understand quantitative aspects of electrolysis; · describe the construction of some primary and secondary batteries and fuel cells; · explain corrosion as an electrochemical process.

We had studied the construction and functioning of Daniell cell (Fig. 2.1). This cell converts the chemical energy liberated during the redox reaction Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s) (2.1) to electrical energy and has an electrical potential equal to 1.1 V when concentration of Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions is unity (1 mol dm–3)*. Such a device is called a galvanic or a voltaic cell. If an external opposite potential is applied in the galvanic cell [Fig. 2.2(a)] and increased slowly, we find that the reaction continues to take place till the opposing voltage reaches the value 1.1 V [Fig. 2.2(b)] when, the reaction stops altogether and no current flows through the cell. Any further increase in the external potential again starts the reaction but in the opposite direction [Fig. 2.2(c)]. It now functions as an electrolytic cell, a device for using electrical energy to carry non-spontaneous chemical reactions. Both types of cells are quite important and we shall study some of their salient features in the following pages. *Strictly speaking activity should be used instead of concentration.

Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s) This reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition gives the overall cell reaction: (i) Cu2+ + 2e– ® Cu(s) (reduction half reaction) (2.2) (ii) Zn(s) ® Zn2+ + 2e– (oxidation half reaction) (2.3) These reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell. The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode, the oxidation half-cell. We can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each halfcell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we do not require a salt bridge. At each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of electron flow. 2.2 Galvanic Cells Rationalised 2023-24 Chemistry 34 The potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the halfcell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the left hand side i.e., Ecell = Eright – Eleft This is illustrated by the following example: Cell reaction: Cu(s) + 2Ag+ (aq) ¾® Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s) (2.4) Half-cell reactions: Cathode (reduction): 2Ag+ (aq) + 2e– ® 2Ag(s) (2.5) Anode (oxidation): Cu(s) ® Cu2+(aq) + 2e– (2.6) It can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction (2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as: Cu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+ (aq)|Ag(s) and we have Ecell = Eright – Eleft = EAg+ úAg – ECu2+úCu (2.7) The potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect to this. According to convention, a half-cell called standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3) represented by Pt(s)ú H2 (g)ú H + (aq), is assigned a zero potential at all temperatures corresponding to the reaction H+ (aq) + e– ® 1 2 H2 (g) The standard hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum electrode coated with platinum black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled through it. The concentration of both the reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is maintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the solution is one molar. 2.2.1 Measurement of Electrode Potential Fig. 2.3: Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). Rationalised 2023-24 35 Electrochemistry At 298 K the emf of the cell, standard hydrogen electrode ççsecond half-cell constructed by taking standard hydrogen electrode as anode (reference half-cell) and the other half-cell as cathode, gives the reduction potential of the other half-cell. If the concentrations of the oxidised and the reduced forms of the species in the right hand half-cell are unity, then the cell potential is equal to standard electrode potential, E o R of the given half-cell. E o = E o R – E o L As E o L for standard hydrogen electrode is zero. E o = E o R – 0 = E o R The measured emf of the cell: Pt(s) ç H2 (g, 1 bar) ç H+ (aq, 1 M) çç Cu2+ (aq, 1 M) ú Cu is 0.34 V and it is also the value for the standard electrode potential of the half-cell corresponding to the reaction: Cu2+ (aq, 1M) + 2 e– ® Cu(s) Similarly, the measured emf of the cell: Pt(s) ç H2 (g, 1 bar) ç H+ (aq, 1 M) çç Zn2+ (aq, 1M) ç Zn is -0.76 V corresponding to the standard electrode potential of the half-cell reaction: Zn2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2e– ® Zn(s) The positive value of the standard electrode potential in the first case indicates that Cu2+ ions get reduced more easily than H+ ions. The reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu (or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion) under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not dissolve in HCl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by hydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or zinc can reduce hydrogen ions). In view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in Fig. 2.1 can be written as: Left electrode: Zn(s) ® Zn2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2 e– Right electrode: Cu2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2 e– ® Cu(s) The overall reaction of the cell is the sum of above two reactions and we obtain the equation: Zn(s) + Cu2+ (aq) ® Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s) emf of the cell = E o cell = E o R – E o L = 0.34V – (– 0.76)V = 1.10 V Sometimes metals like platinum or gold are used as inert electrodes. They do not participate in the reaction but provide their surface for oxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons. For example, Pt is used in the following half-cells: Hydrogen electrode: Pt(s)|H2 (g)| H+ (aq) With half-cell reaction: H+ (aq)+ e– ® ½ H2 (g) Bromine electrode: Pt(s)|Br2 (aq)| Br– (aq) Rationalised 2023-24 Chemistry 36 With half-cell reaction: ½ Br2 (aq) + e– ® Br– (aq) The standard electrode potentials are very important and we can extract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard electrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are given in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species. It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F2 ) has the maximum tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F– ) and therefore fluorine gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of the species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical cells are extensively used for determining the pH of solutions, solubility product, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties and for potentiometric titrations. Intext Questions 2.1 How would you determine the standard electrode potential of the system Mg2+|Mg? 2.2 Can you store copper sulphate solutions in a zinc pot? 2.3 Consult the table of standard electrode potentials and suggest three substances that can oxidise ferrous ions under suitable conditions. 2.3 Nernst Equation EquationEquation We have assumed in the previous section that the concentration of all the species involved in the electrode reaction is unity.

We had studied the construction and functioning of Daniell cell
(Fig. 2.1). This cell converts the chemical energy liberated during the
redox reaction
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s) (2.1)

Such a device is called a galvanic or a
voltaic cell.
If an external opposite potential is applied
in the galvanic cell [Fig. 2.2(a)] and increased
slowly, we find that the reaction continues to
take place till the opposing voltage reaches
the value 1.1 V [Fig. 2.2(b)] when, the reaction
stops altogether and no current flows through
the cell. Any further increase in the external
potential again starts the reaction but in the
opposite direction [Fig. 2.2(c)]. It now functions
as an electrolytic cell, a device for using
electrical energy to carry non-spontaneous
chemical reactions. Both types of cells are

As mentioned earlier a galvanic cell is an electrochemical cell that
converts the chemical energy of a spontaneous redox reaction into
electrical energy. In this device the Gibbs energy of the spontaneous
redox reaction is converted into electrical work which may be used for
running a motor or other electrical gadgets like heater, fan,
geyser, etc.
Daniell cell discussed earlier is one such cell in which the following
redox reaction occurs.
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) ® Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)
This reaction is a combination of two half reactions whose addition
gives the overall cell reaction:
(i) Cu2+ + 2e–
 ® Cu(s) (reduction half reaction) (2.2)
(ii) Zn(s) ® Zn2+ + 2e–
(oxidation half reaction) (2.3)
These reactions occur in two different portions of the Daniell cell.
The reduction half reaction occurs on the copper electrode while the
oxidation half reaction occurs on the zinc electrode. These two portions
of the cell are also called half-cells or redox couples. The copper
electrode may be called the reduction half cell and the zinc electrode,
the oxidation half-cell.
We can construct innumerable number of galvanic cells on the pattern
of Daniell cell by taking combinations of different half-cells. Each halfcell consists of a metallic electrode dipped into an electrolyte. The two
half-cells are connected by a metallic wire through a voltmeter and a
switch externally. The electrolytes of the two half-cells are connected
internally through a salt bridge as shown in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes, both
the electrodes dip in the same electrolyte solution and in such cases we
do not require a salt bridge.
At each electrode-electrolyte interface there is a tendency of metal
ions from the solution to deposit on the metal electrode trying to make
it positively charged. At the same time, metal atoms of the electrode
have a tendency to go into the solution as ions and leave behind the
electrons at the electrode trying to make it negatively charged. At
equilibrium, there is a separation of charges and depending on the
tendencies of the two opposing reactions, the electrode may be positively
or negatively charged with respect to the solution. A potential difference
develops between the electrode and the electrolyte which is called
electrode potential. When the concentrations of all the species involved
in a half-cell is unity then the electrode potential is known as standard
electrode potential. According to IUPAC convention, standard
reduction potentials are now called standard electrode potentials. In a
galvanic cell, the half-cell in which oxidation takes place is called anode
and it has a negative potential with respect to the solution. The other
half-cell in which reduction takes place is called cathode and it has a
positive potential with respect to the solution. Thus, there exists a
potential difference between the two electrodes and as soon as the
switch is in the on position the electrons flow from negative electrode
to positive electrode. The direction of current flow is opposite to that of
electron flow.
2.2 Galvanic Cells
Rationalised 2023-24
Chemistry 34
The potential difference between the two electrodes of a galvanic
cell is called the cell potential and is measured in volts. The cell
potential is the difference between the electrode potentials (reduction
potentials) of the cathode and anode. It is called the cell electromotive
force (emf) of the cell when no current is drawn through the cell. It
is now an accepted convention that we keep the anode on the left and
the cathode on the right while representing the galvanic cell. A galvanic
cell is generally represented by putting a vertical line between metal
and electrolyte solution and putting a double vertical line between
the two electrolytes connected by a salt bridge. Under this convention
the emf of the cell is positive and is given by the potential of the halfcell on the right hand side minus the potential of the half-cell on the
left hand side i.e.,
Ecell = Eright – Eleft
This is illustrated by the following example:
Cell reaction:
Cu(s) + 2Ag+
(aq) ¾® Cu2+(aq) + 2 Ag(s) (2.4)
Half-cell reactions:
Cathode (reduction): 2Ag+
(aq) + 2e– ® 2Ag(s) (2.5)
Anode (oxidation): Cu(s) ® Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
(2.6)
It can be seen that the sum of (3.5) and (3.6) leads to overall reaction
(2.4) in the cell and that silver electrode acts as a cathode and copper
electrode acts as an anode. The cell can be represented as:
Cu(s)|Cu2+(aq)||Ag+
(aq)|Ag(s)
and we have Ecell = Eright – Eleft = EAg+
úAg – ECu2+úCu (2.7)
The potential of individual half-cell cannot be measured. We can
measure only the difference between the two half-cell potentials that
gives the emf of the cell. If we arbitrarily choose the potential of one
electrode (half-cell) then that of the other can be determined with respect
to this. According to convention, a half-cell
called standard hydrogen electrode (Fig.3.3)

The standard hydrogen electrode consists
of a platinum electrode coated with platinum
black. The electrode is dipped in an acidic
solution and pure hydrogen gas is bubbled
through it. The concentration of both the
reduced and oxidised forms of hydrogen is
maintained at unity (Fig. 2.3). This implies
that the pressure of hydrogen gas is one bar
and the concentration of hydrogen ion in the
solution is one molar.

The measured emf of the cell:

is 0.34 V and it is also the value for the standard electrode potential
of the half-cell corresponding to the reaction:
Cu2+ (aq, 1M) + 2 e–

Similarly, the measured emf of the cell:
Pt(s) ç H2
(g, 1 bar) ç H+ (aq, 1 M) çç Zn2+ (aq, 1M) ç Zn
is -0.76 V corresponding to the standard electrode potential of the
half-cell reaction:
Zn2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2e– ® Zn(s)
The positive value of the standard electrode potential in the first
case indicates that Cu2+ ions get reduced more easily than H+
 ions. The
reverse process cannot occur, that is, hydrogen ions cannot oxidise Cu
(or alternatively we can say that hydrogen gas can reduce copper ion)
under the standard conditions described above. Thus, Cu does not
dissolve in HCl. In nitric acid it is oxidised by nitrate ion and not by
hydrogen ion. The negative value of the standard electrode potential
in the second case indicates that hydrogen ions can oxidise zinc (or
zinc can reduce hydrogen ions).
In view of this convention, the half reaction for the Daniell cell in
Fig. 2.1 can be written as:
Left electrode: Zn(s) ® Zn2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2 e–
Right electrode: Cu2+ (aq, 1 M) + 2 e– ® Cu(s)

oxidation or reduction reactions and for the conduction of electrons.
For example, Pt is used in the following half-cells:
Hydrogen electrode: Pt(s)|H2
(g)| H+
(aq)
With half-cell reaction: H+ (aq)+ e– ® ½ H2
(g)
Bromine electrode: Pt(s)|Br2

The standard electrode potentials are very important and we can
extract a lot of useful information from them. The values of standard
electrode potentials for some selected half-cell reduction reactions are
given in Table 2.1. If the standard electrode potential of an electrode
is greater than zero then its reduced form is more stable compared to
hydrogen gas. Similarly, if the standard electrode potential is negative
then hydrogen gas is more stable than the reduced form of the species.
It can be seen that the standard electrode potential for fluorine is the
highest in the Table indicating that fluorine gas (F2
) has the maximum
tendency to get reduced to fluoride ions (F–
) and therefore fluorine
gas is the strongest oxidising agent and fluoride ion is the weakest
reducing agent. Lithium has the lowest electrode potential indicating
that lithium ion is the weakest oxidising agent while lithium metal is
the most powerful reducing agent in an aqueous solution. It may be
seen that as we go from top to bottom in Table 2.1 the standard
electrode potential decreases and with this, decreases the oxidising
power of the species on the left and increases the reducing power of
the species on the right hand side of the reaction. Electrochemical
cells are extensively used for determining the pH of solutions, solubility
product, equilibrium constant and other thermodynamic properties
and for potentiometric titrations.

"An ecosystem can be visualised as a functional unit of
nature, where living organisms interact among themselves
and also with the surrounding physical environment.
Ecosystem varies greatly in size from a small pond to a
large forest or a sea. Many ecologists regard the entire
biosphere as a global ecosystem, as a composite of all
local ecosystems on Earth. Since this system is too much
big and complex to be studied at one time, it is convenient
to divide it into two basic categories, namely the
terrestrial and the aquatic. Forest, grassland and desert
are some examples of terrestrial ecosystems; pond, lake,
wetland, river and estuary are some examples of aquatic
ecosystems. Crop fields and an aquarium may also be
considered as man-made ecosystems.
We will first look at the structure of the ecosystem, in
order to appreciate the input (productivity), transfer of
energy (food chain/web, nutrient cycling) and the output
(degradation and energy loss). We will also look at the
relationships – cycles, chains, webs – that are created as
a result of these energy flows within the system and their
inter- relationship.

BIOLOGY
14.1 ECOSYSTEM – STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
In chapter 13, you have looked at the various components of the
environment- abiotic and biotic. You studied how the individual biotic
and abiotic factors affected each other and their surrounding. Let us look
at these components in a more integrated manner and see how the flow of
energy takes place within these components of the ecosystem.
Interaction of biotic and abiotic components result in a physical
structure that is characteristic for each type of ecosystem. Identification
and enumeration of plant and animal species of an ecosystem gives its
species composition. Vertical distribution of different species occupying
different levels is called stratification. For example, trees occupy top
vertical strata or layer of a forest, shrubs the second and herbs and grasses
occupy the bottom layers.
The components of the ecosystem are seen to function as a unit when
you consider the following aspects:
(i) Productivity;
(ii) Decomposition;
(iii) Energy flow; and
(iv) Nutrient cycling.
To understand the ethos of an aquatic ecosystem let us take a small
pond as an example. This is fairly a self-sustainable unit and rather simple
example that explain even the complex interactions that exist in an aquatic
ecosystem. A pond is a shallow water body in which all the above
mentioned four basic components of an ecosystem are well exhibited.
The abiotic component is the water with all the dissolved inorganic and
organic substances and the rich soil deposit at the bottom of the pond.
The solar input, the cycle of temperature, day-length and other climatic
conditions regulate the rate of function of the entire pond. The autotrophic
components include the phytoplankton, some algae and the floating,
submerged and marginal plants found at the edges. The consumers are
represented by the zooplankton, the free swimming and bottom dwelling
forms. The decomposers are the fungi, bacteria and flagellates especially
abundant in the bottom of the pond. This system performs all the functions
of any ecosystem and of the biosphere as a whole, i.e., conversion of
inorganic into organic material with the help of the radiant energy of the
sun by the autotrophs; consumption of the autotrophs by heterotrophs;
decomposition and mineralisation of the dead matter to release them back
for reuse by the autotrophs, these event are repeated over and over again.
There is unidirectional movement of energy towards the higher trophic
levels and its dissipation and loss as heat to the environment.
14.2. PRODUCTIVITY
A constant input of solar energy is the basic requirement for any ecosystem
to function and sustain. Primary production is defined as the amount of
2022-23
243
ECOSYSTEM
biomass or organic matter produced per unit area over a time period by
plants during photosynthesis. It is expressed in terms of weight (gm–2
) or
energy (kcal m–2
). The rate of biomass production is called productivity.
It is expressed in terms of gm–2
 yr
–1 or (kcal m–2
) yr
–1 to compare the
productivity of different ecosystems. It can be divided into gross primary
productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP). Gross primary
productivity of an ecosystem is the rate of production of organic matter
during photosynthesis. A considerable amount of GPP is utilised by plants
in respiration. Gross primary productivity minus respiration losses (R),
is the net primary productivity (NPP).
GPP – R = NPP
Net primary productivity is the available biomass for the consumption
to heterotrophs (herbiviores and decomposers). Secondary productivity
is defined as the rate of formation of new organic matter by
consumers.
Primary productivity depends on the plant species inhabiting a
particular area. It also depends on a variety of environmental factors,
availability of nutrients and photosynthetic capacity of plants. Therefore,
it varies in different types of ecosystems. The annual net primary
productivity of the whole biosphere is approximately 170 billion tons
(dry weight) of organic matter. Of this, despite occupying about 70 per
cent of the surface, the productivity of the oceans are only 55 billion tons.
Rest of course, is on land. Discuss the main reason for the low
productivity of ocean with your teacher.
14.3 DECOMPOSITION
You may have heard of the earthworm being referred to as the farmer’s
‘friend’. This is so because they help in the breakdown of complex organic
matter as well as in loosening of the soil. Similarly, decomposers break
down complex organic matter into inorganic substances like carbon
dioxide, water and nutrients and the process is called decomposition.
Dead plant remains such as leaves, bark, flowers and dead remains of
animals, including fecal matter, constitute detritus, which is the raw
material for decomposition. The important steps in the process of
decomposition are fragmentation, leaching, catabolism, humification and
mineralisation.
Detritivores (e.g., earthworm) break down detritus into smaller particles.
This process is called fragmentation. By the process of leaching, watersoluble inorganic nutrients go down into the soil horizon and get precipitated
as unavailable salts. Bacterial and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into
simpler inorganic substances. This process is called as catabolism.
It is important to note that all the above steps in decomposition operate
simultaneously on the detritus (Figure 14.1). Humification and
mineralisation occur during decomposition in the soil. Humification leads
2022-23
244
BIOLOGY
to accumulation of a dark coloured amorphous substance called humus
that is highly resistant to microbial action and undergoes decomposition
at an extremely slow rate. Being colloidal in nature it serves as a reservoir
of nutrients. The humus is further degraded by some microbes and release
of inorganic nutrients occur by the process known as mineralisation.
Decomposition is largely an oxygen-requiring process. The rate of
decomposition is controlled by chemical composition of detritus and
climatic factors. In a particular climatic condition, decomposition rate
is slower if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin, and quicker, if detritus is
rich in nitrogen and water-soluble substances like sugars. Temperature
and soil moisture are the most important climatic factors that regulate
decomposition through their effects on the activities of soil microbes.
Warm and moist environment favour decomposition whereas low
temperature and anaerobiosis inhibit decomposition resulting in build
up of organic materials.

ECOSYSTEM
14.4 ENERGY FLOW
Except for the deep sea hydro-thermal ecosystem, sun is the only source
of energy for all ecosystems on Earth. Of the incident solar radiation less
than 50 per cent of it is photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). We
know that plants and photosynthetic bacteria (autotrophs), fix Sun’s
radiant energy to make food from simple inorganic materials. Plants
capture only 2-10 per cent of the PAR and this small amount of energy
sustains the entire living world. So, it is very important to know how the
solar energy captured by plants flows through different organisms of an
ecosystem. All organisms are dependent for their food on producers, either
directly or indirectly. So you find unidirectional flow of energy from the
sun to producers and then to consumers. Is this in keeping with the first
law of thermodynamics?
Further, ecosystems are not exempt from the Second Law of
thermodynamics. They need a constant supply of energy to synthesise
the molecules they require, to counteract the universal tendency toward
increasing disorderliness.
The green plant in the ecosystem are called producers. In a terrestrial
ecosystem, major producers are herbaceous and woody plants. Likewise,
producers in an aquatic ecosystem are various species like phytoplankton,
algae and higher plants.
You have read about the food chains and webs that exist in nature.
Starting from the plants (or producers) food chains or rather webs are
formed such that an animal feeds on a plant or on another animal and in
turn is food for another. The chain or web is formed because of this
interdependency. No energy that is trapped into an organism remains in
it for ever. The energy trapped by the producer, hence, is either passed on
to a consumer or the organism dies. Death of organism is the beginning
of the detritus food chain/web.
All animals depend on plants (directly or indirectly) for their food needs.
They are hence called consumers and also heterotrophs. If they feed on
the producers, the plants, they are called primary consumers, and if the
animals eat other animals which in turn eat the plants (or their produce)
they are called secondary consumers. Likewise, you could have tertiary
consumers too. Obviously the primary consumers will be herbivores.
Some common herbivores are insects, birds and mammals in terrestrial
ecosystem and molluscs in aquatic ecosystem.
The consumers that feed on these herbivores are carnivores, or more
correctly primary carnivores (though secondary consumers). Those
animals that depend on the primary carnivores for food are labelled
secondary carnivores. A simple grazing food chain (GFC) is depicted
below:
Grass Goat Man
 (Producer) (Primary Consumer) (Secondary consumer)
2022-23
246
BIOLOGY
The detritus food chain (DFC) begins with dead organic matter. It is
made up of decomposers which are heterotrophic organisms, mainly
fungi and bacteria. They meet their energy and nutrient requirements by
degrading dead organic matter or detritus. These are also known as
saprotrophs (sapro: to decompose). Decomposers secrete digestive
enzymes that breakdown dead and waste materials into simple, inorganic
materials, which are subsequently absorbed by them.
In an aquatic ecosystem, GFC is the major conduit for energy flow.
As against this, in a terrestrial ecosystem, a much larger fraction of energy
flows through the detritus food chain than through the GFC. Detritus
food chain may be connected with the grazing food chain at some levels:
some of the organisms of DFC are prey to the GFC animals, and in a natural
ecosystem, some animals like cockroaches, crows, etc., are omnivores.
These natural interconnection of food chains make it a food web. How
would you classify human beings!
Organisms occupy a place in the natural surroundings or in a
community according to their feeding relationship with other organisms.
Based on the source of their nutrition or food, organisms occupy a specific
place in the food chain that is known as their trophic level. Producers
belong to the first trophic level, herbivores (primary consumer) to the
second and carnivores (secondary consumer) to the third (Figure 14.2).
Figure 14.2 Diagrammatic representation of trophic levels in an ecosystem
246
2022-23
247
ECOSYSTEM
Figure 14.3 Energy flow through different trophic levels
The important point to note is that the amount of energy decreases at
successive trophic levels. When any organism dies it is converted to
detritus or dead biomass that serves as an energy source for decomposers.
Organisms at each trophic level depend on those at the lower trophic level
for their energy demands.
Each trophic level has a certain mass of living material at a particular
time called as the standing crop. The standing crop is measured as the
mass of living organisms (biomass) or the number in a unit area. The
biomass of a species is expressed in terms of fresh or dry weight.
Measurement of biomass in terms of dry weight is more accurate. Why?
The number of trophic levels in the grazing food chain is restricted as
the transfer of energy follows 10 per cent law – only 10 per cent of the
energy is transferred to each trophic level from the lower trophic level. In
nature, it is possible to have so many levels – producer, herbivore, primary
carnivore, secondary carnivore in the grazing food chain (Figure 14.3) .
Do you think there is any such limitation in a detritus food chain?
14.5 ECOLOGICAL PYRAMIDS
You must be familiar with the shape of a pyramid. The base of a pyramid
is broad and it narrows towards the apex. One gets a similar shape,
whether you express the food or energy relationship between organisms
2022-23
248
BIOLOGY
at different trophic levels. This, relationship is expressed in terms of
number, biomass or energy. The base of each pyramid represents the
producers or the first trophic level while the apex represents tertiary or
top level consumer. The three types of ecological pyramids that are usually
studied are (a) pyramid of number; (b) pyramid of biomass and (c) pyramid
of energy. For detail (see Figure 14.4 a, b, c and d).
Figure 14.4 (a) Pyramid of numbers in a grassland ecosystem. Only three top-carnivores are
supported in an ecosystem based on production of nearly 6 millions plants

249
ECOSYSTEM
Figure 14.4 (d) An ideal pyramid of energy. Observe that primary producers convert only 1% of
 the energy in the sunlight available to them into NPP
Any calculations of energy content, biomass or numbers, has to include
all organisms at that trophic level. No generalisations we make will be
true if we take only a few individuals at any trophic level into account.
Also a given organism may occupy more than one trophic level
simultaneously. One must remember that the trophic level represents a
functional level, not a species as such. A given species may occupy more
than one trophic level in the same ecosystem at the same time; for example,
a sparrow is a primary consumer when it eats seeds, fruits, peas, and a
secondary consumer when it eats insects and worms. Can you work out
how many trophic levels human beings function at in a food chain?
In most ecosystems, all the pyramids, of number, of energy and
biomass are upright, i.e., producers are more in number and biomass
than the herbivores, and herbivores are more in number and biomass
than the carnivores. Also energy at a lower trophic level is always more
than at a higher level.
There are exceptions to this generalisation: If you were to count the
number of insects feeding on a big tree what kind of pyramid would you
get? Now add an estimate of the number of small birds depending on the
insects, as also the number of larger birds eating the smaller. Draw the
shape you would get.
The pyramid of biomass in sea is generally inverted because the
biomass of fishes far exceeds that of phytoplankton. Isn’t that a paradox?
How would you explain this?
Pyramid of energy is always upright, can never be inverted, because
when energy flows from a particular trophic level to the next trophic level,
some energy is always lost as heat at each step. Each bar in the energy
pyramid indicates the amount of energy present at each trophic level in a
given time or annually per unit area.
2022-23
250
BIOLOGY
However, there are certain limitations of ecological pyramids such as
it does not take into account the same species belonging to two or more
trophic levels. It assumes a simple food chain, something that almost
never exists in nature; it does not accommodate a food web. Moreover,
saprophytes are not given any place in ecological pyramids even though
they play a vital role in the ecosystem.
14.6 ECOLOGICAL SUCCESSION
You have learnt in Chapter 13, the characteristics of population and
community and also their response to environment and how such
responses vary from an individual response. Let us examine another aspect
of community response to environment over time.
An important characteristic of all communities is that their
composition and structure constantly change in response to the changing
environmental conditions. This change is orderly and sequential, parallel
with the changes in the physical environment. These changes lead finally
to a community that is in near equilibrium with the environment and
that is called a climax community. The gradual and fairly predictable
change in the species composition of a given area is called ecological
succession. During succession some species colonise an area and their
population become more numerous whereas populations of other species
decline and even disappear.
The entire sequence of communities that successively change in a
given area are called sere(s). The individual transitional communities are
termed seral stages or seral communities. In the successive seral stages
there is a change in the diversity of species of organisms, increase in the
number of species and organisms as well as an increase in the total biomass.
The present day communities in the world have come to be because
of succession that has occurred over millions of years since life started on
earth. Actually succession and evolution would have been parallel
processes at that time.
Succession is hence a process that starts in an area where no living
organisms are there – these could be areas where no living organisms
ever existed, say bare rock; or in areas that somehow, lost all the living
organisms that existed there. The former is called primary succession,
while the latter is termed secondary succession.
Examples of areas where primary succession occurs are newly cooled
lava, bare rock, newly created pond or reservoir. The establishment of a
new biotic community is generally slow. Before a biotic community of
diverse organisms can become established, there must be soil. Depending
mostly on the climate, it takes natural processes several hundred to several
thousand years to produce fertile soil on bare rock.",Educational Materials,

The Last Lesson
About the author
Alphonse Daudet (1840-1897) was a French novelist
and short-story writer. The Last Lesson is set in the
days of the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) in which
France was defeated by Prussia led by Bismarck.
Prussia then consisted of what now are the nations of
Germany, Poland and parts of Austria. In this story the
French districts of Alsace and Lorraine have passed
into Prussian hands. Read the story to find out what
effect this had on life at school.

I started for school very late that morning and was in great
dread of a scolding, especially because M. Hamel had said
that he would question us on participles, and I did not
know the first word about them. For a moment I thought of
running away and spending the day out of doors. It was so
warm, so bright! The birds were chirping at the edge of the
woods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the
Prussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more
tempting than the rule for participles, but I had the
strength to resist, and hurried off to school.
When I passed the town hall there was a crowd in
front of the bulletin-board. For the last two years all our
bad news had come from there — the lost battles, the draft,
the orders of the commanding officer — and I thought to
myself, without stopping, “What can be the matter now?”

The Last Lesson/3
Then, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the
blacksmith, Wachter, who was there, with his apprentice,
reading the bulletin, called after me, “Don’t go so fast,
bub; you’ll get to your school in plenty of time!”
I thought he was making fun of me, and reached
M. Hamel’s little garden all out of breath.
Usually, when school began, there was a great bustle,
which could be heard out in the street, the opening and
closing of desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with
our hands over our ears to understand better, and the
teacher’s great ruler rapping on the table. But now it was
all so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my
desk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything
had to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window
I saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel
walking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his
arm. I had to open the door and go in before everybody. You
can imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was.
But nothing happened. M. Hamel saw me and said
very kindly, “Go to your place quickly, little Franz. We were
beginning without you.”
I jumped over the bench and sat down at my desk. Not
till then, when I had got a little over my fright, did I see
that our teacher had on his beautiful green coat, his frilled
Rationalised 2023-24
4/Flamingo
shirt, and the little black silk
cap, all embroidered, that he
never wore except on
inspection and prize days.
Besides, the whole school
seemed so strange and
solemn. But the thing that
surprised me most was to
see, on the back benches that
were always empty, the village
people sitting quietly like
ourselves; old Hauser, with
his three-cornered hat, the
former mayor, the former
postmaster, and several others besides. Everybody looked
sad; and Hauser had brought an old primer, thumbed at
the edges, and he held it open on his knees with his great
spectacles lying across the pages.
While I was wondering about it all, M. Hamel mounted
his chair, and, in the same grave and gentle tone which he
had used to me, said, “My children, this is the last lesson
I shall give you. The order has come from Berlin to teach
only German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The
new master comes tomorrow. This is your last French
lesson. I want you to be very attentive.”
What a thunderclap these words were to me!
Oh, the wretches; that was what they had put up at
the town-hall!
My last French lesson! Why, I hardly knew how to
write! I should never learn any more! I must stop there, then!
Oh, how sorry I was for not learning my lessons, for seeking
birds’ eggs, or going sliding on the Saar! My books, that had
seemed such a nuisance a while ago, so heavy to carry, my
grammar, and my history of the saints, were old friends now
that I couldn’t give up. And M. Hamel, too; the idea that he
was going away, that I should never see him again, made me
forget all about his ruler and how cranky he was.
Poor man! It was in honour of this last lesson that he
had put on his fine Sunday clothes, and now I understood
Rationalised 2023-24
The Last Lesson/5
why the old men of the village were sitting there in the
back of the room. It was because they were sorry, too, that
they had not gone to school more. It was their way of
thanking our master for his forty years of faithful service
and of showing their respect for the country that was theirs
no more.
While I was thinking of all this, I heard my name called.
It was my turn to recite. What would I not have given to be
able to say that dreadful rule for the participle all through,
very loud and clear, and without one mistake? But I got
mixed up on the first words and stood there, holding on to
my desk, my heart beating, and not daring to look up.
I heard M. Hamel say to me, “I won’t scold you, little
Franz; you must feel bad enough. See how it is! Every day
we have said to ourselves, ‘Bah! I’ve plenty of time. I’ll
learn it tomorrow.’ And now you see where we’ve come out.
Ah, that’s the great trouble with Alsace; she puts off
learning till tomorrow. Now those fellows out there will
have the right to say to you, ‘How is it; you pretend to be
Frenchmen, and yet you can neither speak nor write your
own language?’ But you are not the worst, poor little Franz.
We’ve all a great deal to reproach ourselves with.”
“Your parents were not anxious enough to have you
learn. They preferred to put you to work on a farm or at
the mills, so as to have a little more money. And I? I’ve
been to blame also. Have I not often
sent you to water my flowers
instead of learning your
lessons? And when I
wanted to go fishing,
did I not just give
you a holiday?”
Then, from one
thing to another,
M. Hamel went on
to talk of the
French language,
saying that it was
the most beautiful

The Last Lesson/7
language in the world — the
clearest, the most logical; that
we must guard it among us and
never forget it, because when a
people are enslaved, as long as
they hold fast to their language
it is as if they had the key to their
prison. Then he opened a
grammar and read us our lesson.
I was amazed to see how well I
understood it. All he said seemed
so easy, so easy! I think, too, that
I had never listened so carefully,
and that he had never explained
everything with so much patience.
It seemed almost as if the poor
man wanted to give us all he knew
before going away, and to put it
all into our heads at one stroke.
After the grammar, we had a
lesson in writing. That day M.
Hamel had new copies for us,
written in a beautiful round hand
— France, Alsace, France, Alsace. They looked like little
flags floating everywhere in the school-room, hung from
the rod at the top of our desks. You ought to have seen how
every one set to work, and how quiet it was! The only sound
was the scratching of the pens over the paper. Once some
beetles flew in; but nobody paid any attention to them, not
even the littlest ones, who worked right on tracing their
fish-hooks, as if that was French, too. On the roof the
pigeons cooed very low, and I thought to myself, “Will they
make them sing in German, even the pigeons?”
Whenever I looked up from my writing I saw M. Hamel
sitting motionless in his chair and gazing first at one thing,
then at another, as if he wanted to fix in his mind just how
everything looked in that little school-room. Fancy! For
forty years he had been there in the same place, with his
garden outside the window and his class in front of him,
1. What was Franz expected to
be prepared with for school
that day?
2. What did Franz notice that was
unusual about the school that
day?
3. What had been put up on the
bulletin-board?
Rationalised 2023-24

just like that. Only the desks and benches had been worn
smooth; the walnut-trees in the garden were taller, and
the hopvine that he had planted himself twined about the
windows to the roof. How it must have broken his heart to
leave it all, poor man; to hear his sister moving about in
the room above, packing their trunks! For they must leave
the country next day.
But he had the courage to hear every lesson to the
very last. After the writing, we had a lesson in history,
and then the babies chanted their ba, be bi, bo, bu. Down
there at the back of the room old Hauser had put on his
spectacles and, holding his primer in both hands, spelled
the letters with them. You could see that he, too, was crying;
his voice trembled with emotion, and it was so funny to
hear him that we all wanted to laugh and cry. Ah, how
well I remember it, that last lesson!
All at once the church-clock struck twelve. Then the
Angelus. At the same moment the trumpets of the
Prussians, returning from drill, sounded under our
windows. M. Hamel stood up, very pale, in his chair.
I never saw him look so tall.
“My friends,” said he, “I—I—” But something choked
him. He could not go on.
Then he turned to the blackboard, took a piece of chalk,
and, bearing on with all his
might, he wrote as large as he
could —
“Vive La France!”
Then he stopped and leaned
his head against the wall, and,
without a word, he made a
gesture to us with his hand —
“School is dismissed — you
may go.”

Drama
INTRODUCTION
A drama is a composition in prose or verse
presenting in dialogue a story of life or character,
especially one intended to be acted on the stage.
The essence of drama is the make-believe by which
an actor impersonates a character of the play. The
element of make-believe in drama is much greater
than the average play-goer realises. For instance,
we must regard it as entirely natural that rooms
and houses have one wall ‘missing’ that enables
the audience to witness the action.
Drama is usually divided into tragedy and comedy,
but within this general framework a number of
types and subtypes have been developed. The
tragicomedy, for instance, mixes elements of both
tragedy and comedy; the modern ‘problem-play’
deals with neither of these but with middle class
life and problems.
Furthermore, drama is the literary form most
viable with the modern mass media; and film, radio
and television are producing a vast quantity of it,
ranging from ‘soap opera’ and farce to serious new
works and fine productions of old ones.
Two plays find a place in the section: Chandalika
by Tagore which describes the angst of an
untouchable woman; and an excerpt from Broken
Images by Girish Karnad, which is a monologue
by a celebrity writer that plumbs the depths of her
psyche and recreates her life for the TV viewer.

Chandalika ChandalikaChandalika
Rabindranath Tagore was a poet, novelist, shortstory writer and dramatist. He was awarded the
Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913. Tagore’s interest
in drama was fostered while he was a boy, for
his family enjoyed writing and staging plays. The
music in his plays is instrumental in bringing out
the delicate display of emotion around an idea.
The central interest in his plays is the unfolding
of character; of the opening up of the soul to
enlightenment of some sort.
INTRODUCTION
This short drama is based on the following Buddhist legend.
Ananda, the famous disciple of the Buddha, was one day
returning from a visit when he felt thirsty and, approaching
a well on the way, asked for water from a chandalika, a
girl belonging to the lowest untouchable caste. The girl
gave him water and fell in love with the beautiful monk.
Unable to restrain herself, she made her mother, who knew
the art of magic, work her spell on him. The spell proved
stronger than Ananda’s will and the spell-bound monk
presented himself at their house at night; but, as he saw
the girl spread the couch for him, he was overcome with
shame and remorse and prayed inwardly to his master to
save him. The Buddha heard the prayer and broke the
magic spell and Ananda went away, as pure as he came.
This crude plot of the popular tale, showing how the
psychic power of the Buddha saves his devotee from the
lust of a chandal girl, has been transformed by the poet
Rabindranath Tagore
1861-1941
1
Rationalised 2023-24
205/CHANDALIKA
into a psychological drama of intense spiritual conflict. It
is not the story of a wicked girl roused to lust by the physical
beauty of the monk, but of a very sensitive girl, condemned
by her birth to a despised caste, who is suddenly awakened
to a consciousness of her full rights as a woman by the
humanity of a follower of the Buddha, who accepts water
from her hand and teaches her to judge herself not by the
artificial values that society attaches to the accidents of
birth, but by her capacity for love and service.
This is a great revelation for her, which she calls a
new birth; for she is washed clean of her self-degradation
and rises up a full human being with her right to love and
to give. And since her own self is the most she can give,
and since none is more worthy of the gift of her surrender
than the bhikshu who has redeemed, or, as she puts it,
created her, she yearns to offer herself to him. But Ananda,
detached from all earthly cares and immersed in his inner
self, knows nothing of all this and passes by without
recognising her.
She is humiliated, wounded in her newly awakened
sensibility, and determines to drag the monk from his pride
of renunciation to the abjectness of desire for her. She has
lost all religious scruple or fear, for she owed nothing to
religion save her humiliation.
‘A religion that insults is a false religion. Everyone
united to make me conform to a creed that blinds and
gags. But since that day something forbids me to conform
any longer. I’m afraid of nothing now.’
She forces her mother to exercise her art of magic on
Ananda. She refers to it as the primeval spell, the spell of
the earth, which is far more potent than the immature
sadhana of the monks. The ‘spell of the earth’ proves its
force and Ananda is dragged to their door, his face distorted
with agony and shame. Seeing her redeemer, so noble and
resplendent before, thus cruelly transformed and degraded,
she is horrified at the selfish and destructive nature of
her desire. The hero to whom she yearned to dedicate
herself was not this creature, blinded by lust and darkened
with shame, but Ananda of the radiant form, who had
Rationalised 2023-24
206/KALEIDOSCOPE
given her the gift of a new birth and had revealed her own
true humanity. In remorse she curses herself and falls at
his feet, begging for forgiveness. The mother revokes the
spell and willingly pays the price of such revocation, which
is death. The chandalika is thus redeemed for the second
time, purged of the pride and egoism that had made her
forget that love does not claim possession, but gives
freedom.
Chandalika is a tragedy of self-consciousness overreaching its limit. Self-consciousness, up to a point, is
necessary to self-development; for, without an awareness of
the dignity of one’s own role or function, one cannot give
one’s best to the world. Without rights there can be no
obligations, and service and virtue when forced become marks
of slavery. But self-consciousness, like good wine, easily
intoxicates, and it is difficult to control the dose and have
just enough of it. Vanity and pride get the upper hand and he
who clings to his rights very often trespasses on those of
others. This is what happened to the heroine. Prakriti, in her
eagerness to give, forgot that Ananda need not take; her
devotion grew so passionate that she could not make her
surrender without first possessing. Yet it was inevitable that
it should be so; for a new consciousness, after ages of
suppression, is overpowering and one learns restraint only
after suffering. Hence the tragedy. The good mother who, so
unwillingly, worked the spell to please her importunate
daughter, and who so willingly revoked it to save Ananda,
dies in the process. The daughter, though chastened and
made wise by suffering, has paid a heavy price; for wisdom is
not happiness and renunciation is not fulfilment.

said; self-humiliation is a sin, worse than self-murder.

a Buddhist monk came and stood before me, in his
yellow robes, and said, ‘Give me water’. My heart
leaped with wonder. I started up trembling and bowed
before his feet, without touching them. His form was
radiant as with the light of dawn. I said, ‘I am a
chandalini, and the well-water is unclean’. He said,
‘As I am a human being, so also are you, and all water
is clean and holy that cools our heat and satisfies our
thirst’. For the first time in my life I heard such words,
for the first time I poured water into his cupped
hands—the hands of a man the very dust of whose
feet I would never have dared to touch.
MOTHER. O, you stupid girl, how could you be so reckless?
There will be a price to pay for this madness! Don’t
you know what caste you were born in?
PRAKRITI. Only once did he cup his hands, to take the
water from mine. Such a little water, yet that water
grew to a fathomless, boundless sea. In it flowed all
the seven seas in one, and my caste was drowned,
and my birth washed clean.
MOTHER. Why, even the way you speak is changed. He
has laid your tongue under a spell. Do you understand
yourself what you are saying?
PRAKRITI. Was there no other water, mother, in all Sravasti
city? Why did he come to this well of all wells? I may
truly call it my new birth! He came to give me the
honour of quenching Man’s thirst. That was the mighty
act of merit which he sought. Nowhere else could he
have found the water which could fulfill his holy vow—
no, not in any sacred stream. He said that Janaki
bathed in such water as this, at the beginning of her
forest exile, and that Guhak, the chandal, drew it for
her. My heart has been dancing ever since, and night
and day I hear those solemn tones— ‘Give me water,
give me water’.
MOTHER. I don’t know what to make of it, child; I don’t
like it. I don’t understand the magic of their spells.
Today I don’t recognise your speech; tomorrow,
perhaps, I shall not even recognise your face. Their
spells can make a changeling of the very soul itself.

And so I wait and watch. The midday gong booms
from the palace, the girls take up their water-pots
and go home, the kite soars alone into the far sky,
and I bring my pitcher and sit here at the well by the
wayside.
MOTHER. For whom do you wait?
PRAKRITI. For the wayfarer.
MOTHER. What wayfarer will come to you, you crazy girl?
PRAKRITI. That one wayfarer, mother, the one and only. In
him are all who fare along the ways of all the world.
Day after day goes by, yet he does not come. Though
he spoke no word, his word was given—why does he
not keep his word? For my heart is become like a
waterless waste, where the heat-haze quivers all day
long. Its water cannot be given, for no one comes to
seek it.
MOTHER. I can make nothing of your talk today; it’s as
though you were intoxicated. Tell me plainly, what do
you want?
PRAKRITI. I want him. All unlooked for—he came, and
taught me this marvellous truth, that even my service
will count with the God who guides the world. O words
of great wonder! That I may serve, I, a flower sprung
from a poison-plant! Let him raise that truth, that
flower from the dust, and take it to his bosom.
MOTHER. Be warned, Prakriti, these men’s words are meant
only to be heard, not to be practised. The filth into
which an evil fate has cast you is a wall of mud that
no spade in the world can break through. You are
unclean; beware of tainting the outside world with
your unclean presence. See that you keep to your own
place, narrow as it is. To stray anywhere beyond its
limits is to trespass.

PRAKRITI [sings].
Blessed am I, says the flower, who belong to the
earth.
For I serve you, my God, in this my lowly home.
Make me forget that I am born of dust,
For my spirit is free from it.
When you bend your eyes upon me my petals
tremble in joy;
Give me a touch of your feet and make me heavenly,
For the earth must offer its worship through me.
MOTHER. Child, I’m beginning to understand something
of what you say. You are a woman; by serving you
must worship, and by serving you must rule. Women
alone can in a moment overstep the bounds of caste;
when once the curtains of destiny are drawn aside,
they all stand revealed in their queenliness. You had
a good chance, you know, when the king’s son was
deer-hunting and came to this very well of yours. You
remember, don’t you?
PRAKRITI. Yes, I remember.
MOTHER. Why didn’t you go to the king’s house? He had
forgotten everything in your beauty.
PRAKRITI. Yes, he had forgotten everything—forgotten that
I was a human being. He had gone out hunting beasts;
he saw nothing but the beast whom he wanted to
bind in chains of gold.
MOTHER. At least he noticed your beauty, if only as game
to be hunted. As for the Bhikshu, does he see the
woman in you?
PRAKRITI. You won’t understand, mother, you won’t! I feel
that in all these days he is the first who ever really
recognised me. That is a marvellous thing. I want
him, mother, I want him beyond all measure. I want
to take this life of mine and lay it like a basket of
flowers at his feet. It will not defile them. Let everyone
marvel at my daring! I shall glory in my claim. ‘I am
your handmaid,’ I shall declare—for otherwise I must
lie bound for ever at the whole world’s feet, a slave!
Rationalised 2023-24
211/CHANDALIKA
MOTHER. Why do you get so excited, child? You were born
a slave. It’s the writ of Destiny, who can undo it?
PRAKRITI. Fie, fie, Mother, I tell you again, don’t delude
yourself with this self-humiliation—it is false, and a
sin. Plenty of slaves are born of royal blood, but I am
no slave; plenty of chandals are born of Brahmin
families, but I am no chandal.
MOTHER. I don’t know how to answer you, child. Very
good. I’ll go to him myself, and cling to his feet. ‘You
accept food from every home’, I’ll say. ‘Come to our
house too, and accept from our hands at least a bowl
of water.’
PRAKRITI. No, no, I’ll not call him in that way, from outside.
I’ll send my call into his soul, for him to hear. I am
longing to give myself; it is like a pain at my heart.
Who is going to accept the gift? Who will join with me
in give-and-take? Will he not mingle his longings with
mine, as the Ganges mingles with the black waters of
the Jumna? For music springs up of itself, and he
who came unbidden has left behind him a word of
hope. What is the use of one pitcher of water when
the earth is cracked with drought? Will not the clouds
come of themselves to fill the whole sky, the rain seek
the soil by its own weight?
MOTHER. What is the use of such talk? If the clouds come,
they come: if they don’t, they don’t; if the crops wither,
it’s no concern of theirs! What more can we do than
sit and watch the sky?
PRAKRITI. That won’t do for me; I won’t simply sit and
watch. You know how to work spells; let those spells
be the clasp of my arms, let them drag him here.
MOTHER. What are you saying, wretched girl? Is there no
limit to your recklessness? It would be playing with
fire! Are these bhikshus like ordinary folk? How am I
to work spells on them? I shudder even to think of it.
PRAKRITI. You would have worked them boldly enough on
the king’s son.
MOTHER. I’m not afraid of the king; he might have had me
impaled, perhaps. But these men—they do nothing.
Rationalised 2023-24
212/KALEIDOSCOPE
PRAKRITI. I fear nothing any longer, except to sink back
again, to forget myself again, to enter again the house
of darkness. That would be worse than death! Bring
him here you must! I speak so boldly, of such great
matters—isn’t that in itself a wonder? Who worked
the wonder but he? Shall there not be further wonders?
Shall he not come to my side, and sit with me on the
corner of my cloth?
MOTHER. Suppose I can bring him, are you ready to pay
the price? Nothing will be left to you.
PRAKRITI. No, nothing will be left. The burden and heritage
of birth after birth—nothing will remain. Only let me
bring it all to an end, then I shall live indeed. That’s
why I need him. Nothing will be left me. I have waited
for age after age, and now in this birth my life shall
be fulfilled. My mind is saying it over and over again—
fulfilled! It was for this that I heard those wonderful
words, ‘Give me water’. Today I know that even I can
give. Everyone else had hidden the truth from me. I
sit and watch for his coming today to give, to give, to
give everything I have.
MOTHER. Have you no respect for religion?
PRAKRITI. How can I say? I respect him who respects me.
A religion that insults is a false religion. Everyone
united to make me conform to a creed that blinds and
gags. But since that day something forbids me to
conform any longer. I’m afraid of nothing now. Chant
your spells, bring the Bhikshu to the side of the
chandalini. I myself shall do him honour—no one else
can honour him so well.
MOTHER. Aren’t you afraid of bringing a curse upon
yourself?
PRAKRITI. There has been a curse upon me all my life.
Poison kills poison, they say—so one curse another.
Not another word, mother, not another word. Begin
your spells, I cannot bear any more delay.
MOTHER. Very well, then. What is his name?
PRAKRITI. His name is Ananda.
MOTHER. Ananda? The disciple of the Lord Buddha?
PRAKRITI. Yes, it is he.
Rationalised 2023-24
213/CHANDALIKA
MOTHER. O my heart’s treasure, you are the apple of my
eye—but it’s a great wrong I’m putting my hand to at
your bidding!
PRAKRITI. What wrong? I will bring to my side the one who
brings all near. What crime is there in that?
MOTHER. They draw men by the strength of their virtue.
We drag them with spells, as beasts are dragged in a
noose. We only churn up the mud.
PRAKRITI. So much the better. Without the churning, how
can the well be cleansed?
MOTHER (apostrophising Ananda].
O thou exalted one, thy power to forgive is greater far
than my power to offend. I am about to do thee
dishonour, yet I bow before thee: accept my obeisance,
Lord.
PRAKRITI. What are you afraid of, mother? Yours are the
lips I use, but it’s I who chant the spells. If my longing
can draw him here, and if that is a crime, then I will
commit the crime. I care nothing for a code which
holds only punishment, and no comfort.
MOTHER. You are immensely daring, Prakriti.
PRAKRITI. You call me daring? Think of the might of his
daring! How simply he spoke the words which no one
had ever dared to say to me before! ‘Give me water.’
Such little words, yet as mighty as flame—they filled
all my days with light, they rolled away the black
stone whose weight so long had stopped the fountains
of my heart, and the joy bubbled forth. Your fear is an
illusion, for you did not see him. All morning he had
begged alms in Sravasti city; when his task was done
he came, across the common, past the burning-ground,
along the river bank, with the hot sun on his head—
and all for what? To say that one word, ‘Give me water’,
even to a girl like me. O, it is too wonderful! Whence
did such grace, such love, come down—upon a wretch
unworthy beyond all others? What can I fear now?
‘Give me water’—yes, the water which has filled all
my days to overflowing, which I must needs give or
die! ‘Give me water.’ In a moment I knew that I had
Rationalised 2023-24
214/KALEIDOSCOPE
water, inexhaustible water; to whom should I tell my
joy? And so I call him night and day. If he does not
hear, fear not; chant your spell, he will be able to
bear it.
MOTHER. Look, Prakriti, some men in yellow robes are
going by the road across the common.
PRAKRITI. So they are; all the monks of the sangha, I see.
Don’t you hear them chanting?
[The chant is heard in the distance.]
To the most pure Buddha, mighty ocean of mercy,
Seer of knowledge absolute, pure, supreme,
Of the world’s sin and suffering the Destroyer—
Solemnly to the Buddha I bow in homage.
PRAKRITI. O Mother, see, he is going, there ahead of them
all. He never turned his head or looked towards this
well. He could so easily have said ‘Give me water’
once more before he went. I thought he would never
be able to cast me aside—me, his own handiwork, his
new creation. [She flings herself down and beats her
head on the ground.] This dust, this dust is your place!
O wretched woman, who raised you to bloom for a
moment in the light? Fallen in the end into this same
dust, you must mingle for all time with this same
dust, trampled underfoot by all who travel the road.
MOTHER. Child, dear child, forget it, forget it all. They
have broken your momentary dream, and they are
going away—let them go, let them go. When a thing is
not meant to last, the quicker it goes the better.
Read and find out
Will Prakriti resign herself to her lot?
PRAKRITI. Day after day this cry of desire, moment by
moment this burden of shame; this prisoned bird in
my breast, that beats its wings unto death—do you
call it a dream? A dream, is it, that sinks its sharp
Rationalised 2023-24
215/CHANDALIKA
teeth into the fibres of my heart, and will not loosen
its grip? And they, who have no ties, no joy or sorrow,
no earthly burden, who float along like the clouds in
autumn—are only they awake, are only they real?
MOTHER. O Prakriti, I cannot bear to see you suffer so.
Come, get up, I will chant the spells, I will bring
him. All along the dusty road I will bring him. ‘I
want nothing,’ he says in his pride. I’ll break that
pride and make him come, running and crying ‘I
want, I want’.
PRAKRITI. Mother, yours is an ancient spell, as old as life
itself. Their mantras are raw things of yesterday.
These men can never be a match for you—the knot
of their mantras will be loosened under the stress of
your spells. He is bound to be defeated.
MOTHER. Where are they going?
PRAKRITI. Going? They are going nowhere! During the rains
they remain four months in penance and fasting,
and then they are off again, how should I know
where? That’s what they call being awake!
MOTHER. Then why are you talking of spells, you crazy
thing? He is going so far—how am I to bring him
back?
PRAKRITI. No matter where he goes, you must bring him
back. Distance is nothing for your spells. He showed
no pity to me, I shall show none to him. Chant your
spell, your cruellest spells; wind them about his
mind till every coil bites deep. Wherever he goes, he
shall never escape me!
 MOTHER. You need not fear, it is not beyond our powers. I
will give you this magic mirror; you shall take it in
your hand and dance. His shadow will fall on the
glass, and in it you will see what happens to him
and how near he has come.
PRAKRITI. See there the clouds, the storm clouds, gathered
in the west. The spell will work, mother, it will work.
His dry meditations will scatter like withered leaves;
his lamp will go out, his path will be lost in darkness.
As a bird at dead of night falls fluttering into the

dark courtyard, its nest broken in the storm, even
so shall he be whirled helpless to our doors. The
thunder throbs in my heart, my mind is filled with
the lightning flash, the waves foam high in an ocean
whose shore I cannot see.
MOTHER. Think well even now, lest sudden terror spring
upon you with the work half done. Can you endure
to the end? When the spell has reached its height, it
would cost me my life to undo it. Remember that
this fire will not die down till all that will burn is
burnt to ashes.
PRAKRITI. For whom are you afraid? Is he a common man?
Nothing will hurt him. Let him come, let him tread
the path of fire to the very end. Before me I see in
vision the night of doom, the storm of union, the
bliss of the breaking of worlds.

at last, his cloud-kissing glory broken?
MOTHER. Even now, child, if you say so, I will try to undo
the spell. Let the cords of my life be torn apart and
my life-blood spent, if only that great soul can be
saved.
PRAKRITl. That is best, mother. Let the spells stop, I’ll
have no more... no, no, don’t! Go on—the end of the
path is so near! Make him come to the very end,
make him come right to my bosom! After that I will
blot out all his suffering, emptying my whole world
at his feet. At dead of night the wayfarer will come,
and I will kindle the lamps for him in the flames of

my burning heart. Deep within are springs of nectar,
where he shall bathe and anoint his weary, hot and
wounded limbs. Once again he shall say ‘Give me
water’—water from the ocean of my heart. Yes, that
day will come—go on, go on with the spell.
[Song]
In my own sorrow
Will I quit thy sorrow;
Thy hurt will I bathe
In the deep waters of my pain’s immensity.
My world will I give to the flames,
And my blackened shame shall be cleansed.
My mortal pain will I offer as gift at thy feet.
MOTHER. I never knew it would take so long. My spells
have no more power, child; there is no breath left in
my body.
PRAKRITI. Don’t be afraid, mother; hold out a little longer,
only a little. It will not be long now.
MOTHER. The month of Ashad is here, and their four
months’ fast is at hand.
PRAKRITl. They are gone to Vaisali, to the monastery there.
MOTHER. How pitiless you are! That is so far away.
PRAKRITI. Not very far; seven days’ journey. Fifteen days
have already passed. His seat of meditation has been
shaken at last. He is coming, he is coming! All that
once lay so far away, so many million miles away,
beyond the very sun and moon, immeasurably beyond
the reach of my arms—it is coming, nearer and
nearer! He is coming, and my heart is rocked as by
an earthquake.
MOTHER. I have worked the spell through all its stages—
such force might have brought down Indra of the
thunderbolt himself. And yet he does not come. It is
a fight to the death indeed. What did you see in the
mirror?
PRAKRITI. At first I saw a mist covering the whole sky,
deathly pale like the weary gods after their struggle
with the demons, Through rifts in the mist there
Rationalised 2023-24
218/KALEIDOSCOPE
glimmered fire. After that the mist gathered itself
up into red and angry clusters, like swollen, festering
sores. That day passed. The next day I looked, and
all the background was a deep black cloud, with
lightning playing across it. Before it he was standing,
all his limbs fenced with flame. My blood ran cold,
and I rushed to tell you to stop your spells at once—
but I found you in deep trace, sitting like a log,
breathing hardly, and unconscious. It seemed as
though a fierce fire burned in you, and your fire was
a flaming serpent that hissed and struck in deadly
duel at the fire that wrapped him round. I came
back and took up the mirror; the light was gone—
only torment, unfathomable torment, was in his face.
MOTHER. Yet that did not kill you? The fire of his suffering
burnt into my soul, till I thought I could bear no more.
PRAKRITI. It seemed that the tortured form I saw was not
his only, but mine too; it belonged to us both. In
those awful fires the gold and the copper had been
melted and fused.
MOTHER. And you felt no fear?
PRAKRITI. Something far greater than fear. I beheld the
God of Creation, more terrible far than the God of
Destruction, lashing the flames to work His purposes,
while they writhed and roared in anger. What lay at
his feet in the casket of the seven elements—Life or
Death? My mind swelled with a joy hard to name—
joy in the tremendous detachment of new creation,
free of care or fear, of pity or sorrow. Creation
breaking, burning and melting among the sparks of
the elemental fires. I could not keep still. My whole
soul and body danced and danced together, as the
pointed flames dance in the fire.
MOTHER. And how did your Bhikshu appear?
PRAKRITI. His eyes were fixed motionless upon the
distance, like stars in the evening twilight. I longed
to escape from myself far into boundless space.
MOTHER. When you danced before the mirror, he saw you?
PRAKRITI. Fie upon it, how I am shamed! Again and again
his eyes grew red, as though he were about to curse.
Rationalised 2023-24
219/CHANDALIKA
Again and again he trampled down the glowing fires
of anger, and at last his anger turned upon himself,
quivering, like a spear, and pierced his own breast.
MOTHER. And you bore all this?
PRAKRITI. I was amazed. I, this I, this daughter of yours,
this nobody from nowhere—his suffering and mine
are one today! What holy fire of creation could have
wrought such a union? Who could dream of so great
a thing?
MOTHER. When shall his turmoil be stilled?
PRAKRITl. When my suffering is stilled. How can he attain
his mukti until I attain mine?
MOTHER. When did you last look into your mirror?
PRAKRITl. Yesterday evening. He had passed through the
lion-gate of Vaisali some days before, at dead of
night—seemingly in secret, unknown to the monks.
After that I had sometimes seen him ferried across
rivers or on difficult mountain passes. I had seen
the evening fall, and him alone on the wide commons,
or on the dark forest paths at dead of night. As the
days went by, he fell more deeply under the spell
and became heedless of everything, all the conflict
with his own soul at an end. His face was mazed,
his body slack, his eyes fixed in an unseeing stare,
as though for him there were neither true nor false,
good nor evil—only a blind and thoughtless
compulsion, with no meaning in it.
MOTHER. Can you guess how far he has come today?
PRAKRITI. I saw him yesterday at Patal village on the river
Upali. The river was turbulent with new rains; there
was an old peepul tree by the ghat, fireflies shining
in its branches, and under it a lichened altar. As he
reached it he gave a sudden start and stood still. It
was a place he had known for a long time; I have
heard that one day the Lord Buddha preached there
to King Suprabhas. He sat down and covered his
eyes with his hands—I felt that his dream-spell
might break at any moment. I flung away the mirror,
for I was afraid of what I might see. The whole day
has passed since then, and torn between hope and
Rationalised 2023-24
220/KALEIDOSCOPE
fear I have sat on, not daring to know. Now it is dark
again; on the road goes the watchman calling the
hour, it must be an hour past midnight. O mother,
the time is short, so short; don’t let this night be
wasted; put the whole of your strength into the spell.
MOTHER. Child, I can do no more; the spell is weakening,
I am failing body and soul.
PRAKRITl. It mustn’t weaken now—don’t give up now!

we have bound on him is stretched to the uttermost,
and will not hold. What if he escapes now, a",Educational Materials,

"In Chapter 5, you have seen that water means life to
plants, animals and people. It is difficult for anyone to
live in places where there is no water to drink, where
there is no grass for their cattle to feed on and where
there is no water to help the crops to grow.
We will now learn about the places in the world where
people have learned to cope with extreme harsh
temperatures; in some places as hot as fire and some as
cold as ice. These are the desert areas of the world. These
are characterised by low rainfall, scanty vegetation and
extreme temperatures. Depending on the temperatures
there can be hot deserts or cold deserts. The people
inhabit these lands wherever little water is available to
practise agriculture.
THE HOT DESERT  SAHARA
Look at the map of the world and the
continent of Africa. Locate the Sahara
desert covering a large part of North
Africa. It is the worlds largest desert. It
has an area of around 8.54 million
sq. km. Do you recall that India has an
area of 3.2 million sq. km? The Sahara
desert touches eleven countries. These
are Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali,
Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Sudan,
Tunisia and Western Sahara.
When you think of a desert the picture
that immediately comes to your mind is that of sand. But
besides the vast stretches of sands, that Sahara desert is
covered with, there are also gravel plains and elevated
plateaus with bare rocky surface. These rocky surfaces
may be more than 2500m high at some places.

Climate
The climate of the Sahara desert is scorching hot and
parch dry. It has a short rainy season. The sky is
cloudless and clear. Here, the moisture evaporates
faster than it accumulates. Days are unbelievably hot.
The temperatures during the day may soar as high as
50C, heating up the sand and the bare rocks, which
in turn radiates heat making everything around hot.
The nights may be freezing cold with temperatures
nearing zero degrees.
Flora and Fauna

People
The Sahara desert despite its harsh climate has been
inhabited by various groups of people, who pursue
different activities. Among them are the Bedouins and
Tuaregs. These groups are nomadic tribes rearing
livestock such as goats, sheep, camels and horses.
These animals provide them with milk, hides from
which they make leather for belts, slippers, water
bottles; hair is used for mats, carpets, clothes and
blankets. They wear heavy robes as protection against
dust storms and hot winds.
The oasis in the Sahara and the Nile Valley in Egypt
supports settled population. Since water is available, the
people grow date palms. Crops such as rice, wheat, barley
and beans are also grown. Egyptian cotton, famous
worldwide is grown in Egypt.
The discovery of oil  a product in great demand
throughout the world, in Algeria, Libya and Egypt is
constantly transforming the Sahara desert. Other
minerals of importance that are found in the area include
iron, phosphorus, manganese and uranium.
The cultural landscape of the Sahara is undergoing
change. Gleaming glass cased office buildings tower over
mosques and superhighways crisscross the ancient camel
paths. Trucks are replacing camels in the salt trade.

"THE COLD DESERT - LADAKH
Ladakh is a cold desert lying in the Great Himalayas,
on the eastern side of Jammu and Kashmir (Fig. 10.4).
The Karakoram Range in the north and the Zanskar
mountains in the south enclose it. Several rivers flow
through Ladakh, Indus being the most important
among them. The rivers form deep valleys and gorges.
Several glaciers are found in Ladakh, for example the
Gangri glacier.
The altitude in Ladakh varies from about 3000m
in Kargil to more than 8,000m in the Karakoram.
Due to its high altitude, the climate is extremely cold
and dry. The air at this altitude is so thin that the
heat of the sun can be felt intensely. The day
temperatures in summer are just above zero degree
and the night temperatures well below 30C. It is
freezing cold in the winters when the temperatures may
remain below 40C for most of the time. As it lies

in the rain shadow of the Himalayas, there is little
rainfall, as low as 10 cm every year. The area
experiences freezing winds and burning hot sunlight.
You will be surprised to know that if you sit in the
sun with your feet in the shade, you may suffer from
both sunstroke and frost bite at the same time.
Flora and Fauna
Due to high aridity, the vegetation is sparse. There are
scanty patches of grasses and shrubs for animals to
graze. Groves of willows and poplars are seen in the
valleys. During the summers, fruit trees such as apples,
apricots and walnuts bloom. Several species of birds are
sighted in Ladakh. Robins, redstarts, Tibetan snowcock,
raven and hoopoe are common. Some of these are
migratory birds. The animals of Ladakh are wild goats,
wild sheep, yak and special kinds of dogs. The animals
are reared to provide for the milk, meat and hides. Yaks
milk is used to make cheese and butter. The hair of the
sheep and goat is used to make woollens.
People
Do you find any resemblance between the people of
Ladakh and the inhabitants of Tibet and Central Asia?
The people here are either Muslims or Buddhists. In
fact several Buddhists monasteries dot the Ladakhi
landscape with their traditional gompas. Some
famous monasteries are Hemis, Thiksey, Shey and
Lamayuru (Fig. 10.5).
In the summer season the people are busy cultivating
barley, potatoes, peas, beans and turnip. The climate in
winter months is so harsh that
people keep themselves engaged in
festivities and ceremonies. The
women are very hard working. They
work not only in the house and

Desert Game
This is a class room activity involving all the students. The teacher will create a
list of desert creatures. The number of the creatures should be same as the number
of students in the class. The creatures can be picked up from the categories of
mammals, birds and reptiles. Mammals can include  camel, yak, fox, sheep, goat,

Birds  raven, eagle, vulture, turkey
Reptiles  snakes 
Assign one desert creature to each student. Ask the student to write three
characteristics of the creature on plain sheet of paper. (students can use index
cards of size 10 cm  15 cm). Questions such as - in what type of deserts it is
found? Major adaptation? Use to man?
These characteristics will be used as clues in the guessing game. On the board
make three columns  mammals, birs and reptiles. Paste a sheet of paper in the
column under the particular category. The class can be divided in three to four
groups. They will compete against each other in the desert game. Each group now
takes turn in guessing the correct answer. Explain to the class that they have to
guess what animal matches the characteristics listed on the paper.
For example:
 Animal of hot desert
 Has double set of eyelashes to keep away the sand
 The hide is used for making water bottles
 The correct answer is camel. Within the group there will be a student who has
prepared the card. That student should not answer. Ten points are awarded for
the correct answer.

"The d-block of the periodic table contains the elements
of the groups 3-12 in which the d orbitals are
progressively filled in each of the four long periods.
The f-block consists of elements in which 4 f and 5 f
orbitals are progressively filled. They are placed in a
separate panel at the bottom of the periodic table. The
names transition metals and inner transition metals
are often used to refer to the elements of d-and
f-blocks respectively.
There are mainly four series of the transition metals,
3d series (Sc to Zn), 4d series (Y to Cd), 5d series (La
and Hf to Hg) and 6d series which has Ac and elements
from Rf to Cn. The two series of the inner transition
metals; 4f (Ce to Lu) and 5f (Th to Lr) are known as
lanthanoids and actinoids respectively.
Originally the name transition metals was derived
from the fact that their chemical properties were
transitional between those of s and p-block elements.
Now according to IUPAC, transition metals are defined
as metals which have incomplete d subshell either in
neutral atom or in their ions. Zinc, cadmium and

"the non-transition elements. Hence, transition elements
and their compounds are studied separately. However,
the usual theory of valence as applicable to the nontransition elements can be applied successfully to the
transition elements also.
Various precious metals such as silver, gold and
platinum and industrially important metals like iron,
copper and titanium belong to the transition metals series.
In this Unit, we shall first deal with the electronic
configuration, occurrence and general characteristics of
transition elements with special emphasis on the trends
in the properties of the first row (3d) transition metals
along with the preparation and properties of some
important compounds. This will be followed by
consideration of certain general aspects such as electronic
configurations, oxidation states and chemical reactivity
of the inner transition metals.
THE TRANSITION ELEMENTS (d-BLOCK)
The dblock occupies the large middle section of the periodic table
flanked between s and p blocks in the periodic table. The dorbitals
of the penultimate energy level of atoms receive electrons giving rise to
four rows of the transition metals, i.e., 3d, 4d, 5d and 6d. All these
series of transition elements are shown in Table 4.1.
In general the electronic configuration of outer orbitals of these elements
is (n-1)d

.
The (n1) stands for the inner d orbitals which may have one to ten
electrons and the outermost ns orbital may have one or two electrons.
However, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very
little energy difference between (n-1)d and ns orbitals. Furthermore,
half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A
consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations
of Cr and Cu in the 3d series. For example, consider the case of Cr,
which has 3d

 configuration instead of 3d

; the energy gap
between the two sets (3d and 4s) of orbitals is small enough to prevent

these elements are completely filled in the ground state as well as in
their common oxidation states. Therefore, they are not regarded as
transition elements.
The d orbitals of the transition elements protrude to the periphery of
an atom more than the other orbitals (i.e., s and p), hence, they are more
influenced by the surroundings as well as affect the atoms or molecules
surrounding them. In some respects, ions of a given d

configuration
(n = 1  9) have similar magnetic and electronic properties. With partly
filled d orbitals these elements exhibit certain characteristic properties
such as display of a variety of oxidation states, formation of coloured
ions and entering into complex formation with a variety of ligands.
The transition metals and their compounds also exhibit catalytic
property and paramagnetic behaviour. All these characteristics have
been discussed in detail later in this Unit.
There are greater similarities in the properties of the transition
elements of a horizontal row in contrast to the non-transition elements.
However, some group similarities also exist. We shall first study the
general characteristics and their trends in the horizontal rows

Fig. 4.1: Trends in melting points of
transition elements
The transition metals (with the exception
of Zn, Cd and Hg) are very hard and have low
volatility. Their melting and boiling points are
high. Fig. 4.1 depicts the melting points of
transition metals belonging to 3d, 4d and 5d
series. The high melting points of these metals
are attributed to the involvement of greater
number of electrons from (n-1)d in addition to
the ns electrons in the interatomic metallic
bonding. In any row the melting points of these
metals rise to a maximum at d
5
 except for
anomalous values of Mn and Tc and fall
regularly as the atomic number increases.
They have high enthalpies of atomisation which
are shown in Fig. 4.2. The maxima at about
the middle of each series indicate that one

"favourable for strong interatomic interaction. In general, greater the
number of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since
the enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the
standard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy
of atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their
reactions (see later for electrode potentials).
Another generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 4.2 is that the
metals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of
atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an
important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent
metal  metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals.
Fig. 4.2
Trends in enthalpies
of atomisation of
transition elements
In general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive
decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the
new electron enters a d orbital each time the nuclear charge increases
by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a d electron is
not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the
nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic
radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a
given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An
interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared
with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves
in Fig. 4.3 show an increase from the first (3d) to the second (4d) series
of the elements but the radii of the third (5d) series are virtually the
same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This
phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the 4f orbitals which
must be filled before the 5d series of elements begin. The filling of 4f",Educational Materials,
"increase in atomic size with increasing atomic number. The net result
of the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third d series
exhibit similar radii (e.g., Zr 160 pm, Hf 159 pm) and have very similar
physical and chemical properties much more than that expected on
the basis of usual family relationship.
The factor responsible for the lanthanoid
contraction is somewhat similar to that observed
in an ordinary transition series and is attributed
to similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of
one electron by another in the same set of orbitals.
However, the shielding of one 4f electron by
another is less than that of one d electron by
another, and as the nuclear charge increases
along the series, there is fairly regular decrease
in the size of the entire 4f n
 orbitals.
The decrease in metallic radius coupled with
increase in atomic mass results in a general
increase in the density of these elements. Thus,
from titanium (Z = 22) to copper (Z = 29) the
significant increase in the density may be noted
(Table 4.2).

"There is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the
transition elements from left to right due to an increase in nuclear
charge which accompanies the filling of the inner d orbitals. Table
4.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first
series of transition elements. These values show that the successive
enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case
of non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along
a series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation
along a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy,
in general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second
and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much
higher along a series.
The irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of
3d series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for
by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies
of 4s and 3d orbitals. You have learnt that when d-block elements form
ions, ns electrons are lost before (n  1) d electrons. As we move along
the period in 3d series, we see that nuclear charge increases from
scandium to zinc but electrons are added to the orbital of inner subshell,
i.e., 3d orbitals. These 3d electrons shield the 4s electrons from the
increasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer
shell electrons can shield one another. Therefore, the atomic radii
decrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly
along the 3d series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have d
n
configurations with no 4s electrons. A general trend of increasing values
of second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge
increases because one d electron does not shield another electron from
the influence of nuclear charge because d-orbitals differ in direction.
However, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation
enthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn2+ and Fe3+ respectively. In both
the cases, ions have d
5
 configuration. Similar breaks occur at
corresponding elements in the later transition series.
The interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic
configuration d
n
 is as follows:
The three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are
attraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the",Educational Materials,
"electrons and the exchange energy. Exchange energy is responsible for
the stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately
proportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in
the degenerate orbitals. When several electrons occupy a set of
degenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum
possible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds
rule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability
increases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of
exchange energy at d
6
 configuration. Mn+
 has 3d
54s
1
 configuration and
configuration of Cr+
 is d
5
, therefore, ionisation enthalpy of Mn+
 is lower
than Cr+
. In the same way, Fe2+ has d
6
 configuration and Mn2+ has 3d
5
configuration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe2+ is lower than the Mn2+
.
In other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is
lower than that of Mn.
The lowest common oxidation state of these metals is +2. To
form the M2+ ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and
second ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of
atomisation. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy
which shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where M
+
 ions
have the d
5
 and d
10 configurations respectively. The value for Zn is
correspondingly low as the ionisation causes the removal of one 4s
electron which results in the formation of stable d
10 configuration.
The trend in the third ionisation enthalpies is not complicated by
the 4s orbital factor and shows the greater difficulty of removing an
electron from the d
5
 (Mn2+) and d
10 (Zn2+) ions. In general, the third
ionisation enthalpies are quite high. Also the high values for third
ionisation enthalpies of copper, nickel and zinc indicate why it is

A few moments later we all lifted our eyes in
awe as a spectacular array of South African jets,
helicopters and troop carriers roared in perfect
formation over the Union Buildings. It was not only
a display of pinpoint precision and military force,
but a demonstration of the militarys loyalty to
democracy, to a new government that had been
freely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the
highest generals of the South African defence force
and police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and
medals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged
their loyalty. I was not unmindful of the fact that
not so many years before they would not have
saluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron of Impala
jets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue
and gold of the new South African flag.
The day was symbolised for me by the playing of
our two national anthems, and the vision of whites
singing Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika and blacks singing
Die Stem, the old anthem of the Republic. Although
that day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem
they once despised, they would soon know the
words by heart.
On the day of the inauguration, I was
overwhelmed with a sense of history. In the first
decade of the twentieth century, a few years after
the bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth,
the white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched
up their differences and erected a system of racial
domination against the dark-skinned peoples of their
own land. The structure they created formed the
basis of one of the harshest, most inhumane,
societies the world has ever known. Now, in the

regardless of the colour of their skin.
That day had come about through the
unimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people,
people whose suffering and courage can never be
counted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so
many other days, that I was simply the sum of all
those African patriots who had gone before me. That
long and noble line ended and now began again
with me. I was pained that I was not able to thank
them and that they were not able to see what their
sacrifices had wrought.
The policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting
wound in my country and my people. All of us will
spend many years, if not generations, recovering
from that profound hurt. But the decades of
oppression and brutality had another, unintended,

courage, wisdom and generosity that their like may
never be known again. Perhaps it requires such
depths of oppression to create such heights of
character. My country is rich in the minerals and
gems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always
known that its greatest wealth is its people, finer
and truer than the purest diamonds.
It is from these comrades in the struggle that I
learned the meaning of courage. Time and again, I
have seen men and women risk and give their lives
for an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks
and torture without breaking, showing a strength
and resilience that defies the imagination. I learned
that courage was not the absence of fear, but the
triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does
not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.
No one is born hating another person because of
the colour of his skin, or his background, or his
religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can
learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love
comes more naturally to the human heart than its
opposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when
my comrades and I were pushed to our limits, I would
see a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards,
perhaps just for a second, but it was enough to
reassure me and keep me going. Mans goodness is
a flame that can be hidden but never extinguished.

society, each man is able to fulfil those obligations
according to his own inclinations and abilities. But
in a country like South Africa, it was almost
impossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil
both of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of
colour who attempted to live as a human being was
punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who
tried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably
ripped from his family and his home and was forced
to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy
and rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to
place my people above my family, but in attempting
to serve my people, I found that I was prevented
from fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a
father and a husband.
I was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born
free  free in every way that I could know. Free to
run in the fields near my mothers hut, free to swim
in the clear stream that ran through my village, free
to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad
backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my
father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was
not troubled by the laws of man or God.
It was only when I began to learn that my boyhood
freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a
young man that my freedom had already been taken
from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a
student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the
transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night,
read what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as
a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the
basic and honourable freedoms of achieving my
potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and
having a family  the freedom not to be obstructed
in a lawful life.
But then I slowly saw that not only was I not
free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I
saw that it was not just my freedom that was
curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked
like I did. That is when I joined the African National
Congress, and that is when the hunger for my own

of my people. It was this desire for the freedom of
my people to live their lives with dignity and selfrespect that animated my life, that transformed a
frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a
law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that
turned a family-loving husband into a man without
a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a

even enjoy the poor and limited freedoms I was

Freedom is indivisible; the chains on anyone of

chains on all of my people were the chains on me.
I knew that the oppressor must be liberated just
as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away
another mans freedom is a prisoner of hatred; he is
locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrowmindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away

The tiger behind the bars of his cage growls,
The tiger behind the bars of his cage snarls,
The tiger behind the bars of his cage roars.
Then he thinks.
It would be nice not to be behind bars all
The time
Because they spoil my view
I wish I were wild, not on show.
But if I were wild, hunters might shoot me,
But if I were wild, food might poison me,
But if I were wild, water might drown me.
Then he stops thinking
And...

The tiger behind the bars of his cage snarls,
The tiger behind the bars of his cage roars.

The Panther
His vision, from the constantly passing bars,
has grown so weary that it cannot hold
anything else. It seems to him there are
a thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.
As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,
the movement of his powerful soft strides
is like a ritual dance around a centre
in which a mighty will stands paralysed.
Only at times, the curtain of the pupils
lifts, quietly. An image enters in,
rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,
plunges into the heart and is gone.

I was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born
free  free in every way that I could know. Free to
run in the fields near my mothers hut, free to swim
in the clear stream that ran through my village, free
to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad
backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my
father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was
not troubled by the laws of man or God.
It was only when I began to learn that my boyhood
freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a
young man that my freedom had already been taken
from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a
student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the
transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night,
read what I pleased and go where I chose. Later, as
a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the
basic and honourable freedoms of achieving my
potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and
having a family  the freedom not to be obstructed
in a lawful life.
But then I slowly saw that not only was I not
free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I
saw that it was not just my freedom that was
curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked
like I did. That is when I joined the African National

my people to live their lives with dignity and selfrespect that animated my life, that transformed a
frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a
law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that
turned a family-loving husband into a man without
a home, that forced a life-loving man to live like a

Freedom is indivisible; the chains on anyone of

chains on all of my people were the chains on me.
I knew that the oppressor must be liberated just
as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away
another mans freedom is a prisoner of hatred; he is
locked behind the bars of prejudice and narrowmindedness. I am not truly free if I am taking away
someone elses freedom, just as surely as I am not

"COMPARING QUANTITIES 79
7.1 Recalling Ratios and Percentages
We know, ratio means comparing two quantities.
A basket has two types of fruits, say, 20 apples and 5 oranges.
Then, the ratio of the number of oranges to the number of apples = 5 : 20.
The comparison can be done by using fractions as,
5
20 =
1
4
The number of oranges is
1
4
th the number of apples. In terms of ratio, this is
1 : 4, read as, 1 is to 4
Number of apples to number of oranges =
20 4
5 1
= which means, the number of apples
is 4 times the number of oranges. This comparison can also be done using percentages.
There are 5 oranges out of 25 fruits.
So percentage of oranges is
5 4 20
20%
25 4 100
 = = OR
[Denominator made 100].
Since contains only apples and oranges,
So, percentage of apples + percentage of oranges = 100
or percentage of apples + 20 = 100
or percentage of apples = 100  20 = 80
Thus the basket has 20% oranges and 80% apples.
Example 1: A picnic is being planned in a school for Class VII. Girls are 60% of the

3. If their first stop is at a place 22 km from the school, what per cent of the total
distance of 55 km is this? What per cent of the distance is left to be covered?
Solution:
1. To find the ratio of girls to boys.
Ashima and John came up with the following answers.
They needed to know the number of boys and also the total number of students.
Ashima did this John used the unitary method
Let the total number of students There are 60 girls out of 100 students.
be x. 60% of x is girls. There is one girl out of
100
60 students.
Therefore, 60% of x = 18 So, 18 girls are out of how many students?
60
100
 x = 18 OR Number of students =
100 18
60

or, x =
18 100
60

 = 30 = 30
Number of students = 30.
So, the number of boys = 30  18 = 12.
Hence, ratio of the number of girls to the number of boys is 18 : 12 or
18
12 =
3

.

 is written as 3 : 2 and read as 3 is to 2.
2. To find the cost per person.
Transportation charge = Distance both ways  Rate
= ` (55  2)  12
= ` 110  12 = ` 1320
Total expenses = Refreshment charge
+ Transportation charge
= ` 4280 + ` 1320
= ` 5600
Total number of persons =18 girls + 12 boys + 2 teachers
= 32 persons
Ashima and John then used unitary method to find the cost per head.
For 32 persons, amount spent would be ` 5600.
The amount spent for 1 person = `
5600
32
 = ` 175.
3. The distance of the place where first stop was made = 22 km.

Ashima used this method: John used the unitary method:

OR Out of 1 km,
22
55 km are travelled.
 Out of 100 km,
22
55  100 km are travelled.
That is 40% of the total distance is travelled.
TRY THESE

100 the ratio by =1
100
and converting to
percentage.
Both came out with the same answer that the distance from their school of the place where
they stopped at was 40% of the total distance they had to travel.
Therefore, the percent distance left to be travelled = 100%  40% = 60%.

WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. When we factorise an expression, we write it as a product of factors. These factors may be
numbers, algebraic variables or algebraic expressions.
2. An irreducible factor is a factor which cannot be expressed further as a product of factors.
3. A systematic way of factorising an expression is the common factor method. It consists of
three steps: (i) Write each term of the expression as a product of irreducible factors (ii) Look
for and separate the common factors and (iii) Combine the remaining factors in each term in
accordance with the distributive law.
4. Sometimes, all the terms in a given expression do not have a common factor; but the terms can
be grouped in such a way that all the terms in each group have a common factor. When we do
this, there emerges a common factor across all the groups leading to the required factorisation
of the expression. This is the method of regrouping.
5. In factorisation by regrouping, we should remember that any regrouping (i.e., rearrangement)
of the terms in the given expression may not lead to factorisation. We must observe the
expression and come out with the desired regrouping by trial and error.

7. In expressions which have factors of the type (x + a) (x + b), remember the numerical term gives ab. Its
factors, a and b, should be so chosen that their sum, with signs taken care of, is the coefficient of x.
8. We know that in the case of numbers, division is the inverse of multiplication. This idea is applicable
also to the division of algebraic expressions.
9. In the case of division of a polynomial by a monomial, we may carry out the division either by
dividing each term of the polynomial by the monomial or by the common factor method.
10. In the case of division of a polynomial by a polynomial, we cannot proceed by dividing each term
in the dividend polynomial by the divisor polynomial. Instead, we factorise both the polynomials
and cancel their common factors.
11. In the case of divisions of algebraic expressions that we studied in this chapter, we have

1. Why did Oliver live in the orphanage?
2. Who was Mr Bumble?
3. What meals were the boys given?
4. What did Oliver say to Mr Bumble?
5. The boys were given three meals a day. Then why
were they always hungry?
(i) Because the soup they were given was never enough.
(ii) Because they worked very hard all day long.
(iii) Because the older boys drank up their soup.
Oliver was a nine-year-old boy. He lived with other homeless boys
in an orphanage. He was pale and thin as were the other boys living
there. This was because they had to work hard but were never given
enough to eat. The owner of the orphanage, Mr Bumble, was a
cruel man and he ill-treated the boys.
The boys were always hungry It was true that they were given
three meals a day but each meal consisted only of a bowl of watery
soup. They were almost starving. So it was decided by them to ask
the master for more soup. But who would bell the cat? Finally the
task fell to Oliver.
When all the boys had assembled in the cold stone hall for their
evening meal, the soup was served. It soon disappeared. The boys
whispered to one another and one boy pushed Oliver a little. Oliver,
making a brave effort, stood up, walked up to the master with his
bowl and spoon in his hand, and said tremblingly, Please sir, I
want some more.

Respecting elders and their experience
Looking at the lighter side of life
Teachers should encourage children to read classics in English as well as in any
other languages they know, to enhance their reading habit.
It is also important for children to understand that all poems need not rhyme. There
are also poems that are in blank verse though there is a basic rhythm to such poems.
This Unit presents a story of Premchand translated into English, setting forth
translation as a means of understanding other cultures.
The teacher should view children's talk as a valuable resource. Conversing in small
groups can nurture the abilities to compare and contrast, to wonder and remember,
to guess and challenge, to judge and evaluate.
Children can be asked to enact different emotions like joy, anger, excitement,
sadness etc.
Children can discuss their interactions with parents and other elders and share the
reasons why sometimes they dislike being told what to do /not do.
The writing exercises, creative writing and the letter writing should be done
after a general discussion in class so that every child is clear about what has to
be written. E.g. the meanings of the should be clear to the
children. The use of the dictionary should be advised and encouraged
throughout.
Through the medium of creative dramatics children can become whatever they
wish to be. Teachers can plan for experiences in dramatic expression
and interpretation.

"slapping it on the crowd players. The idea was to close every
pore on the surface of the face in the process of applying
make-up. He wasnt exactly a boy; he was in his early forties,
having entered the studios years ago in the hope of becoming
a star actor or a top screen writer,
director or lyrics writer. He was a
bit of a poet.
In those days I worked in a
cubicle, two whole sides of which
were French windows. (I didnt
know at that time they were called
French windows.) Seeing me
sitting at my desk tearing up
newspapers day in and day out,
most people thought I was doing
next to nothing. It is likely that
the Boss thought likewise too. So
anyone who felt I should be given
some occupation would barge into
my cubicle and deliver an extended lecture. The boy in the
make-up department had decided I should be enlightened
on how great literary talent was being allowed to go waste in
a department fit only for barbers and perverts. Soon I was
praying for crowd-shooting all the time. Nothing short of it
could save me from his epics.
In all instances of frustration, you will always find
the anger directed towards a single person openly or covertly
and this man of the make-up department was convinced
that all his woes, ignominy and neglect were due to
Kothamangalam Subbu. Subbu was the No. 2 at Gemini
Studios. He couldnt have had a more encouraging opening
in films than our grown-up make-up boy had. On the
contrary he must have had to face more uncertain and
difficult times, for when he began his career, there were
no firmly established film producing companies or studios.
Even in the matter of education, specially formal education,
Subbu couldnt have had an appreciable lead over our boy.
But by virtue of being born a Brahmin  a virtue, indeed!
 he must have had exposure to more affluent situations

and people. He had the ability to look cheerful at all times
even after having had a hand in a flop film. He always had
work for somebody  he could never do things on his own
 but his sense of loyalty made him identify himself with
his principal completely and turn his entire creativity to
his principals advantage. He was tailor-made for films.
Here was a man who could be inspired when commanded.
The rat fights the tigress underwater and kills her but
takes pity on the cubs and tends them lovingly  I dont
know how to do the scene, the producer would say and
Subbu would come out with four ways of the rat pouring
affection on its victims offspring. Good, but I am not sure
it is effective enough, the producer would say and in a
minute Subbu would come out with fourteen more
alternatives. Film-making must have been and was so easy
with a man like Subbu around and if ever there was a man
who gave direction and definition to Gemini Studios during
its golden years, it was Subbu. Subbu had a separate
identity as a poet and though he was certainly capable of
more complex and higher forms, he deliberately chose to
address his poetry to the masses. His success in films
overshadowed and dwarfed his literary achievements  or
so his critics felt. He composed several truly original story
poems in folk refrain and diction and also wrote a sprawling
novel Thillana Mohanambal with dozens of very deftly etched
characters. He quite successfully recreated the mood and
manner of the Devadasis of the early 20th century. He
was an amazing actor  he never aspired to the lead roles
 but whatever subsidiary role he played in any of the
films, he performed better than the supposed main players.
He had a genuine love for anyone he came across and his
house was a permanent residence for dozens of near and
far relations and acquaintances. It seemed against Subbus
nature to be even conscious that he was feeding and
supporting so many of them. Such a charitable and
improvident man, and yet he had enemies! Was it because
he seemed so close and intimate with The Boss? Or was it
his general demeanour that resembled a sycophants? Or
his readiness to say nice things about everything? In any

case, there was this man in the make-up department who
would wish the direst things for Subbu.
You saw Subbu always with The Boss but in the
attendance rolls, he was grouped under a department called
the Story Department comprising a lawyer and an assembly
of writers and poets. The lawyer was also officially known
as the legal adviser, but everybody referred to him as the
opposite. An extremely talented actress, who was also
extremely temperamental, once blew over on the sets. While
everyone stood stunned, the lawyer quietly switched on
the recording equipment. When the actress paused for
breath, the lawyer said to her, One minute, please, and
played back the recording. There was nothing incriminating
or unmentionably foul about the actresss tirade against
the producer. But when she heard her voice again through
the sound equipment, she was struck dumb. A girl from
the countryside, she hadnt gone through all the stages of
worldly experience that generally precede a position of
importance and sophistication that she had found herself
catapulted into. She never quite recovered from the terror
she felt that day. That was the end of a brief and brilliant
acting career  the legal adviser,
who was also a member of the
Story Department, had
unwittingly brought about that
sad end. While every other
member of the Department wore
a kind of uniform  khadi dhoti
with a slightly oversized and
clumsily tailored white khadi shirt
 the legal adviser wore pants
and a tie and sometimes a coat
that looked like a coat of mail.
Often he looked alone and
helpless  a man of cold logic in
a crowd of dreamers  a neutral
man in an assembly of Gandhiites
and khadiites. Like so many of those who were close to
The Boss, he was allowed to produce a film and though a

lot of raw stock and pancake were used on it, not much
came of the film. Then one day The Boss closed down the
Story Department and this was perhaps the only instance
in all human history where a lawyer lost his job because
the poets were asked to go home.
Gemini Studios was the favourite haunt of poets like
S.D.S.Yogiar3
, Sangu Subramanyam, Krishna Sastry and
Harindranath Chattopadhyaya4
. It had an excellent mess
which supplied good coffee at all times of the day and for
most part of the night. Those were the days when Congress
rule meant Prohibition and meeting over a cup of coffee
was rather satisfying entertainment. Barring the office boys
and a couple of clerks, everybody else at the Studios
radiated leisure, a pre-requisite for poetry. Most of them
wore khadi and worshipped Gandhiji but beyond that they
had not the faintest appreciation for political thought of
any kind. Naturally, they were all averse to the term
Communism. A Communist was a godless man  he had
no filial or conjugal love; he had no compunction about
killing his own parents or his children; he was always out
to cause and spread unrest and violence among innocent
and ignorant people. Such notions which prevailed
everywhere else in South India at that time also, naturally,
floated about vaguely among the khadi-clad poets of Gemini
Studios. Evidence of it was soon forthcoming.
When Frank Buchmans Moral Re-Armament army,
some two hundred strong, visited Madras sometime in 1952,
they could not have found a warmer host in India than the
Gemini Studios. Someone called the group an international
circus. They werent very good on the trapeze and their
acquaintance with animals was only at the dinner table,
but they presented two plays in a most professional manner.
Their Jotham Valley and The Forgotten Factor ran several
shows in Madras and along with the other citizens of the
city, the Gemini family of six hundred saw the plays over
and over again. The message of the plays were usually

About the author
Asokamitran (19312017), a Tamil writer, recounts
his years at Gemini Studios in his book My Years with
Boss which talks of the influence of movies on every
aspect of life in India. The Gemini Studios, located in
Chennai, was set up in 1940. It was one of the most
influential film-producing organisations of India in the
early days of Indian film-making. Its founder was S.S.
Vasan. The duty of Asokamitran in Gemini Studios was
to cut out newspaper clippings on a wide variety of
subjects and store them in files. Many of these had to
be written out by hand. Although he performed an
insignificant function he was the most well-informed of
all the members of the Gemini family. The following is
an excerpt from his book My Years with Boss.

brief life and an even briefer stay in Madras, Robert Clive
seems to have done a lot of moving, besides fighting some
impossible battles in remote corners of India and marrying
a maiden in St. Marys Church in Fort St. George in
Madras.
The make-up room had the look of a hair-cutting salon
with lights at all angles around half a dozen large mirrors.
They were all incandescent lights, so you can imagine the
fiery misery of those subjected to make-up. The make-up
department was first headed by a Bengali who became too
big for a studio and left. He was succeeded by a
Maharashtrian who was assisted by a Dharwar Kannadiga,
an Andhra, a Madras Indian Christian, an Anglo-Burmese
and the usual local Tamils. All this shows that there was a
great deal of national integration long before A.I.R. and
Doordarshan began broadcasting programmes on national
integration. This gang of nationally integrated make-up men
could turn any decent-looking person into a hideous crimson
hued monster with the help of truck-loads of pancake and a
number of other locally made potions and lotions. Those
were the days of mainly indoor shooting, and only five
per cent of the film was shot outdoors. I suppose the sets
and studio lights needed the girls and boys to be made to
look ugly in order to look presentable in the movie. A strict
hierarchy was maintained in the
make-up department. The chief
make-up man made the chief actors
and actresses ugly, his senior
assistant the second hero and
heroine, the junior assistant the main
comedian, and so forth. The players
who played the crowd were the
responsibility of the office boy. (Even

Gemini Studio had an office boy!) On

" Investments in education convert human beings into human capital; human
capital represents enhanced labour productivity, which is an acquired ability
and an outcome of deliberate investment decisions with an expectation that
it will increase future income sources.
 Investments in education, on-the-job training, health, migration and
information are the sources of human capital formation.
 The concept of physical capital is the base for conceptualising human capital.
There are some similarities as well as dissimilarities between the two forms
of capital formation.
 Investment in human capital formation is considered as efficient and growth
enhancing.
 Human development is based on the idea that education and health are
integral to human well-being because only when people have the ability to
read and write and the ability to lead a long and healthy life, will they be
able to make other choices which they value.
 The percentage of expenditure on education of the total government
expenditure indicates the importance of education in the scheme of things
for the government.

"Chhotanagpur plateau region has the
maximum concentration of iron and steel
industries. It is largely, because of the relative
advantages this region has for the development
of this industry. These include, low cost of iron
ore, high grade raw materials in proximity,
cheap labour and vast growth potential in the
home market.
Aluminium Smelting
Aluminium smelting is the second most
important metallurgical industry in India. It is
light, resistant to corrosion, a good conductor of
heat, malleable and becomes strong when it is
mixed with other metals. It is used to
manufacture aircraft, utensils and wires. It has
gained popularity as a substitute of steel, copper,
zinc and lead in a number of industries.
Aluminium smelting plants in the country
are located in Odisha, West Bengal, Kerala,
Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and
Tamil Nadu.
Bauxite, the raw material used in the
smelters is a very bulky, dark reddish coloured
rock. The flow chart given below shows the
process of manufacturing aluminium. Regular
supply of electricity and an assured source of
raw material at minimum cost are the two
prime factors for location of the industry.
Chemical Industries
The Chemical industry in India is fast growing
and diversifying. It comprises both large and
small scale manufacturing units. Rapid growth
has been recorded in both inorganic and
organic sectors. Inorganic chemicals include
sulphuric acid (used to manufacture fertilizers,
synthetic fibres, plastics, adhesives, paints,
dyes stuffs), nitric acid, alkalies, soda ash (used
to make glass, soaps and detergents, paper)
and caustic soda. These industries are widely
spread over the country.
Why do you think it is so?
Organic chemicals include petrochemicals,
which are used for manufacturing of synthetic
fibers, synthetic rubber, plastics, dye-stuffs,

"Industrial Pollution and Environmental
Degradation
Although industries contribute significantly to
Indias economic growth and development, the
increase in pollution of land, water, air, noise
and resulting degradation of environment that
they have caused, cannot be overlooked.
Industries are responsible for four types of
pollution: (a) Air (b) Water (c) Land (d) Noise.
The polluting industries also include thermal
power plants.
Air pollution is caused by the presence of high
proportion of undesirable gases, such as
sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Airborne particulate materials contain both solid
and liquid particles like dust, sprays mist and
smoke. Smoke is emitted by chemical and
paper factories, brick kilns, refineries and
smelting plants, and burning of fossil fuels in
big and small factories that ignore pollution
norms. Toxic gas leaks can be very hazardous
with long-term effects. Are you aware of the
Bhopal Gas tragedy that occurred? Air
pollution adversely affects human health,
animals, plants, buildings and the atmosphere
as a whole.
Water pollution is caused by organic and
inorganic industrial wastes and affluents
discharged into rivers. The main culprits in this
regard are paper, pulp, chemical, textile and
dyeing, petroleum refineries, tanneries and
electroplating industries that let out dyes,
detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals like
lead and mercury pesticides, fertilisers,
synthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and
rubber, etc. into the water bodies. Fly ash,
phospo- gypsum and iron and steel slags are
the major solid wastes in India.
Thermal pollution of water occurs when hot
water from factories and thermal plants is
drained into rivers and ponds before cooling.
What would be the effect on aquatic life?
Wastes from nuclear power plants, nuclear
and weapon production facilities cause
cancers, birth defects and miscarriages. Soil
and water pollution are closely related.
Dumping of wastes specially glass, harmful
chemicals, industrial effluents, packaging, salts
and garbage renders the soil useless. Rain
water percolates to the soil carrying the
pollutants to the ground and the ground water
also gets contaminated.
Noise pollution not only results in irritation
and anger, it can also cause hearing
impairment, increased heart rate and blood
pressure among other physiological effects.
Unwanted sound is an irritant and a source of
stress. Industrial and construction activities,
machinery, factory equipment, generators,
saws and pneumatic and electric drills also
make a lot of noise.
Control of Environmental Degradation
Every litre of waste water discharged by our
industry pollutes eight times the quantity of
freshwater. How can the industrial pollution of
fresh water be reduced? Some suggestions are-
(i) minimising use water for processing by
reusing and recycling it in two or more
successive stages
(ii) harvesting of rainwater to meet water
requirements
(iii) treating hot water and effluents before
releasing them in rivers and ponds.
Treatment of industrial effluents can be
done in three phases
(a) Primary treatment by mechanical means.
This involves screening, grinding,
flocculation and sedimentation.
(b) Secondary treatment by biological process
(c) Tertiary treatment by biological,
chemical and physical processes. This
involves recycling of wastewater.
Overdrawing of ground water reserves by
industry where there is a threat to ground
water resources also needs to be regulated
legally. Particulate matter in the air can be
reduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories
with electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters,
scrubbers and inertial separators. Smoke
can be reduced by using oil or gas instead

of coal in factories. Machinery and
equipment can be used and generators
should be fitted with silencers. Almost all
machinery can be redesigned to increase
energy efficiency and reduce noise. Noise
absorbing material may be used apart from
personal use of earplugs and earphones.

requires integration of economic development
with environmental concerns.
(a) Optimum utilisation of equipment
adopting latest techniques and
upgrading existing equipment.
(b) Minimising waste generation by
maximising ash utilisation.
(c) Providing green belts for nurturing ecological

"Nylon
Nylon was the first true synthetic fibre (totally manufactured from
chemicals) to be manufactured. It was first introduced as bristles for tooth
brushes. In 1940, the first fabrics from Nylon were socks and stocking
which were very successful. Thereafter, it was used for all kinds of fabrics.
It also provided the impetus for other synthetic fibres which followed.
Properties
	 Nylon filaments are usually smooth and shiny, with uniform diameter.
	 Nylon has very good strength and abrasion resistance. Its resistance to
abrasion makes it appropriate to be used in brushes, carpets, etc.
	 Nylon is a highly elastic fibre. Very fine and transparent fibres are used
for one-size garments like stockings.
	 Nylon is a popular fabric used in apparel, socks, undergarments,
swimsuits, gloves, nets, sarees, etc. It is a leading fibre in the
manufacture of hosiery and lingerie. For outerwear it may be blended
with other fibres.
Polyester
Polyester is another manufactured synthetic fibre. It is also referred to as
Terylene or Terene.
Properties
	 Polyester fibre has uniform diameter, smooth surface and rod like
appearance. It can be made in any strength, length and diameter as
per the requirements of the end use. The fibre is partially transparent
and lustrous.
	 The moisture regain of polyester is very low, i.e., it does not absorb
water easily. Thus, it is not very comfortable to wear in hot dry summer
months.
	 The most advantageous property of polyster is its wrinkle resistance. It
is one of the most commonly used fibre for blending with rayon, cotton
and wool and, to some extent, spun silk.
Acrylic
This is another synthetic fibre. It resembles wool so much that even an
expert may not be able to find the difference between the two. It is commonly
called as Cashmilon. It is cheaper than wool.
Properties
Like all manufactured fibres the length, diameter and fineness of the
fibre are controlled by the manufacturer. The fibre can be made in varied
degrees of crimp and luster.

	 Acrylic is not very strong and its strength is similar to cotton. The
fibres have high elongation with good elastic recovery.
Acrylic is used as a substitute for wool and is used in childrens wear,
apparels, blankets and knitted goods.	
 Elastomeric fibres
Apart from the fibres mentioned so far, there are a few less known ones.
These are elastic, rubbers like substances and can be produced in various
forms. In its natural form they include rubber and the synthetic equivalent
is spandex or Lycra. These are usually used as blends with any of the
above fibres with low elasticity.
Having studied about fabrics in this chapter, you will be introduced
to the world of apparel, i.e., clothes, made from fabrics later under the
section Childhood.
Knowing about fabrics is important for the adolescent as it would
enable one to make wise selection of clothes  an interest that is commonly

o you recall the processes of
digestion, circulation and
respiration which you have
studied in your previous classes? These
processes are essential for the survival
of every individual. You have also learnt
about the process of reproduction in
plants. Reproduction is essential for the
continuation of a species. Imagine what
would have happened if organisms had
not reproduced. You will realise that
reproduction is very important as it
ensures the continuation of similar
kinds of individuals, generation after
generation.
You have already learnt in your
previous class about reproduction in
plants. In this chapter, we shall learn
how reproduction takes place in
animals.
6.1 Modes of Reproduction
Have you seen the young ones
of different animals? Try to name some
of the young ones by completing
Table 6.1 shown in examples at S. No.
1 and 5.
You must have seen the young
ones of various animals being born.
Can you tell how chicks and
caterpillars are born? How are kittens
and puppies born? Do you think that
these young ones looked the same
before they were born as they do now?
Let us find out.
Just as in plants, there are two modes
by which animals reproduce. These are:
(i) Sexual reproduction, and
(ii) Asexual reproduction.
6.2 Sexual Reproduction
Try to recall reproduction in plants
which you studied in Class VII. You will
remember that plants that reproduce
sexually have male and female
reproductive parts. Can you name these
parts? In animals also, males and
females have different reproductive parts
or organs. Like plants, the reproductive
parts in animals also produce gametes
that fuse to form a zygote. It is the zygote
which develops into a new individual.
This type of reproduction beginning
from the fusion of male and female
gametes is called sexual reproduction.
Let us find out the reproductive parts

in humans and study the process of
reproduction in them.
Male Reproductive Organs
The male reproductive organs include a
pair of testes (singular, testis), two sperm
ducts and a penis (Fig. 6.1). The testes
produce the male gametes called
sperms. Millions of sperms are produced
by the testes. Look at Fig. 6.2 which
shows the picture of a sperm. Though
sperms are very small in size, each has
a head, a middle piece and a tail. Does
it appear to be a single cell? Indeed, each
sperm is a single cell with all the usual
cell components.

organs in humans
What purpose does the
tail in a sperm serve?
Fig. 6.3 : Female reproductive organs in

Female Reproductive Organs
The female reproductive organs are a pair

Boojho recalls that the size
of eggs in animals varies.
The egg may be very small
as in humans, much larger
as in hens. Ostrich egg is
the largest!
Fertilisation
The first step in the process of
reproduction is the fusion of a sperm
and an ovum. When sperms come in
contact with an egg, one of the sperms
may fuse with the egg. Such fusion of
the egg and the sperm is called
fertilisation (Fig. 6.5). During
fertilisation, the nuclei of the sperm and
the egg fuse to form a single nucleus.
This results in the formation of a
fertilised egg or zygote (Fig. 6.6). Did

nuclei
The process of fertilisation is the
meeting of an egg cell from the mother
and a sperm cell from the father. So,
the new individual inherits some
characteristics from the mother and
some from the father. Look at your
brother or sister. See if you can recognise
some characters in them similar to those
of your mother or your father.
Fertilisation which takes place inside
the female body is called internal
fertilisation. Internal fertilisation
occurs in many animals including
humans, cows, dogs and hens.",Educational Materials,
"Have you heard of
test tube babies?
Boojho and Pahelis teacher once told
them in the class that in some women
oviducts are blocked. These women
are unable to bear babies because
sperms cannot reach the egg for
fertilisation. In such cases, doctors
collect freshly released egg and
sperms and keep them together for a
few hours for IVF or in vitro
fertilisation (fertilisation outside the
body). In case fertilisation occurs,
the zygote is allowed to develop for
about a week and then it is placed in
the mothers uterus. Complete
development takes place in the uterus
and the baby is born like any other
baby. Babies born through this
technique are called test-tube
babies. This term is actually

female lays hundreds of eggs. Unlike
hens egg, frogs egg is not covered by a
shell and it is comparatively very
delicate. A layer of jelly holds the eggs
together and provides protection to the
eggs (Fig. 6.7).
You will be surprised to know that
in many animals fertilisation takes
place outside the body of the female.
In these animals, fertilisation takes
place in water. Let us find out how
this happens.
Activity 6.1
Visit some ponds or slow-flowing
streams during spring or rainy
season. Look out for clusters of
frogs eggs floating in water.
Write down the colour and size of
the eggs.
During spring or rainy season, frogs
and toads move to ponds and slowflowing streams. When the male and
female come together in water, the
As the eggs are laid, the male
deposits sperms over them. Each
sperm swims randomly in water with
the help of its long tail. The sperms
come in contact with the eggs. This
results in fertilisation. This type of
fertilisation in which the fusion of a
male and a female gamete takes place
outside the body of the female is called
external fertilisation. It is very
common in aquatic animals such as
fish, starfish, etc.

Development of Embryo
Fertilisation results in the formation of
zygote which begins to develop into an
embryo [Fig. 6.8(a)]. The zygote divides
repeatedly to give rise to a ball of cells
[Fig. 6.8(b)]. The cells then begin to form
groups that develop into different tissues
and organs of the body. This developing
structure is termed an embryo. The
embryo gets embedded in the wall of the
uterus for further development
[Fig. 6.8(c)].
The embryo continues to develop in
the uterus. It gradually develops body

Though these animals lay
hundreds of eggs and release
millions of sperms, all the eggs
do not get fertilised and develop
into new individuals.
This is because the eggs and
sperms get exposed to water
movement, wind and rainfall.
Also, there are other animals in
the pond which may feed
on eggs. Thus, production
of large number of eggs and
sperms is necessary to
ensure fertilisation

When the development of the foetus is

place inside the egg shell during this
period? After the chick is completely
developed it bursts open the egg shell.
In animals which undergo external
fertilisation, development of the embryo
takes place outside the female body. The
embryos continue to grow within their
egg coverings. After the embryos develop,
the eggs hatch. You must have seen
numerous tadpoles swimming in ponds
and streams.
Viviparous and Oviparous Animals
We have learnt that some animals give
birth to young ones while some animals
lay eggs which later develop into young
ones. The animals which give birth to
young ones are called viviparous
animals. Those animals which lay eggs
are called oviparous animals. The
following activity will help you
understand better and differentiate
between viviparous and oviparous
animals.
Activity 6.2
Try to observe eggs of the following
organisms  frog, lizard, butterfly
or moth, hen and crow or any other
bird. Were you able to observe eggs
of all of them? Make drawings of the
eggs that you have observed.
The eggs of a few animals are easy
to observe because their mothers lay
them outside their bodies. These are
examples of oviparous animals. But you
would not be able to collect the eggs of
a dog, cow or cat. This is because they
do not lay eggs. The mother gives birth
to the young ones. These are examples
of viviparous animals.
Internal fertilisation takes place in
hens also. But, do hens give birth to
babies like human beings and cows? You
know that they do not. Then, how are
chicks born? Let us find out.
Soon after fertilisation, the zygote
divides repeatedly and travels down the
oviduct. As it travels down, many
protective layers are formed around it.
The hard shell that you see in a hens
egg is one such protective layer.
After the hard shell is formed around
the developing embryo, the hen finally
lays the egg. The embryo takes about 3
weeks to develop into a chick. You must
have seen the hen sitting on the eggs to
provide sufficient warmth. Did you know
that development of the chick takes",Educational Materials,
"Can you now give some more
examples of viviparous and oviparous

Young Ones to Adults
The new individuals which are born or
hatched from the eggs continue to grow
till they become adults. In some
animals, the young ones may look very
different from the adults. The life cycle
of frog is shown in Fig. 6.10.
Observe the different stages of frog
starting from the egg to the adult stage.
We find that there are three distinct

adult. Dont the tadpoles look so
different from the adults? Can you
imagine that these tadpoles would some
day become frogs?
The tadpoles transform into adults
capable of jumping and swimming. The
transformation of the larva into an adult
through drastic changes is called
metamorphosis. What about the
changes that we observe in our body as
we grow? Do you think we too undergo
metamorphosis? In human beings,
body parts similar to those present in
the adults are present from the time
of birth.
6.3 Asexual Reproduction

In each hydra, there may be one or
more bulges. These bulges are the
developing new individuals and they are
called buds. Recall the presence of buds
in yeast. In hydra too the new individuals
develop as outgrowths from a single
parent. This type of reproduction in
which only a single parent is involved is
called asexual reproduction. Since new
individuals develop from the buds in
hydra, this type of asexual reproduction
is called budding.
Another method of asexual
reproduction is observed in the
microscopic organism, amoeba. Let us
see how this happens.
You have already learnt about the
structure of amoeba. You will recall that
amoeba is a single-celled organism
[Fig. 6.12(a)]. It begins the process of
reproduction by the division of its
nucleus into two nuclei [Fig. 6.12(b)].
This is followed by division of its body
into two, each part receiving a nucleus
[Fig. 6.12(c)]. Finally, two amoebae are
produced from one parent amoeba

Story of Dolly, the Clone
Cloning is the production of an exact copy of a cell, any other living part, or a
complete organism. Cloning of an animal was successfully performed for the first
time by Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh,
Scotland. They successfully cloned a sheep named Dolly [Fig. 6.13 (c)]. Dolly was
born on 5th July 1996 and was the first mammal to be cloned.
(a) Finn Dorsett sheep (b) Scottish blackface ewe (c) Dolly
Fig. 6.13
During the process of cloning Dolly, a cell was collected from the mammary gland
of a female Finn Dorsett sheep [Fig. 6.13 (a)]. Simultaneously, an egg was obtained
from a Scottish blackface ewe [Fig. 6.13 (b)]. The nucleus was removed from the
egg. Then, the nucleus of the mammary gland cell from the Finn Dorsett sheep
was inserted into the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe whose nucleus had been
removed. The egg thus produced was implanted into the Scottish blackface ewe.
Development of this egg followed normally and finally Dolly was born. Though
Dolly was given birth by the Scottish blackface ewe, it was found to be absolutely
identical to the Finn Dorsett sheep from which the nucleus was taken. Since the
nucleus from the egg of the Scottish blackface ewe was removed, Dolly did not
show any character of the Scottish blackface ewe. Dolly was a healthy clone of
the Finn Dorsett sheep and produced several offspring of her own through normal
sexual means. Unfortunately, Dolly died on 14th February 2003 due to a certain
lung disease.
Since Dolly, several attempts have been made to produce cloned mammals.
However, many die before birth or die soon after birth. The cloned animals are
many-a-times found to be born with severe abnormalities.
reproduction in which an animal
reproduces by dividing into two
individuals is called binary fission.
Apart from budding and binary fission,
there are other methods by which a
single parent reproduces young ones.
You will study about these in your
higher classes.

 WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT
 There are two modes by which animals reproduce. These are: (i) Sexual reproduction, and
(ii) Asexual reproduction.
 Reproduction resulting from the fusion of male
and female gametes is called sexual
reproduction.
 The reproductive organs in the female include
ovaries, oviducts and uterus.
 The reproductive organs in male include
testes, sperm ducts and penis.
 The ovary produces female gametes called ova
and the testes produce male gametes called
sperms.
 The fusion of ovum and sperm is called fertilisation.
The fertilised egg is called a zygote.
 Fertilisation that takes place inside the female
body is called internal fertilisation. This is
observed in human beings and other animals
such as hens, cows and dogs.
 Fertilisation that takes place outside the
female body is called external fertilisation. This
is observed in frogs, fish, starfish, etc.
 The zygote divides repeatedly to give rise to an
embryo.
 The embryo gets embedded in the wall of the
uterus for further development.
 The stage of the embryo in which all the body
parts are identifiable is called foetus.
 Animals such as human beings, cows and
dogs which give birth to young ones are called
viviparous animals.
 Animals such as hen, frog, lizard and butterfly
which lay eggs are called oviparous animals.
 The transformation of the larva into adult
through drastic changes is called
metamorphosis.
 The type of reproduction in which only a single
parent is involved is called asexual
reproduction.
 In hydra, new individuals develop from buds.
This method of asexual reproduction is called
budding.
 Amoeba reproduces by dividing itself into two.
This type of asexual reproduction is called
binary fission.

Hydra is transparent, jelly-like and with tentacles. It clings to the
jar with the base of its body. If the jar is shaken, the hydra will
contract instantly into a small blob, at the same time drawing its
tentacles in.

healthy so that she can lay eggs. A queen bee lays thousands of eggs. The
fertilised eggs hatch into females, while the unfertilised eggs give rise to males,

n Class VII, you have learnt how
objects move. Do you recall how we
can decide whether an object is
moving faster than the other? What does
the distance moved by an object in unit
time indicate? You also know that a
moving object like a ball rolling on the
ground slows down. Sometimes it may
change its direction of motion. It is also
possible that the ball may slow down
and also change its direction. Have you
ever wondered what makes an object
slow down or go faster, or change its
direction of motion?
Let us recall some of our everyday
experiences. What do you do to make
a football move? What do you do to
make a moving ball move faster? How
does a goalkeeper stop a ball? A
hockey player changes the direction
of the moving ball with a flick of the
stick. How do fielders stop a ball hit
by a batsman? (Fig. 8.1). In all these
situations the ball is either made to
move faster or slower or its direction
of motion is changed.
We often say that a force has been
applied on a ball when it is kicked,
pushed, thrown or flicked. What is a
force? What can it do to bodies on which
it is applied? We shall seek answers to
such questions in this chapter.
8.1 Force  A Push or a Pull
Actions like picking, opening,
shutting, kicking, hitting, lifting,
flicking, pushing, pulling are often

can be grouped as a pull or a push or
both? Can we infer from this, that to move
an object, it has to be pushed or pulled?
In science, a push or a pull on an
object is called a force. Thus, we can
say that the motion imparted to objects
was due to the action of a force. When
does a force come into play? Let us

simply does not move. Is it not similar to
the situation shown in Fig. 8.3 (b)? The
team that pulls harder, that is, applies a
larger force, finally wins the game.
What do these examples suggest
about the nature of force?
Forces applied on an object in the
same direction add to one another. Now
recall what happened when you and
your friend pushed the heavy box in the
same direction in Activity 8.2.
If the two forces act in the opposite
directions on an object, the net force acting
on it is the difference between the two
forces. What did you observe in Activity
8.2 when both of you were pushing the
heavy box from opposite directions?
Recall that in the tug-of-war when
two teams pull equally hard, the rope
does not move in any direction.
So, we learn that a force could be
larger or smaller than the other or equal
to each other. The strength of a force is
usually expressed by its magnitude. We
have also to specify the direction in
which a force acts. Also, if the direction
or the magnitude of the applied force
changes, its effect also changes.

Let us now find out what happens when
a force acts on an object.
Activity 8.3
Take a rubber ball and place it on a
level surface such as a table top or
a concrete floor. Now, gently push
the ball along the level surface
(Fig. 8.6). Does the ball begin to
move? Push the ball again while it
is still moving. Is there any change
in its speed? Does it increase or
decrease?
Next, place your palm in front
of the moving ball. Remove your
palm as soon as the moving ball
touches it. Does your palm apply a
force on the ball? What happens to
the speed of the ball now? Does it
increase or decrease? What would
happen if you let your palm hold
the moving ball?
Fig. 8.6 : A ball at rest begins to move
when a force is applied on it
I have seen
children competing with one
another in moving a rubber tyre
or a ring by pushing it
(Fig. 8.7). I now understand
why the speed of the tyre
increases whenever it is
pushed.
Fig. 8.7 : To move a tyre faster it has to be
pushed repeatedly
You might recall similar situations.
For example, while taking a penalty kick
in football, the player applies a force on
the ball. Before being hit, the ball was at
rest and so its speed was zero. The
applied force makes the ball move
towards the goal. Suppose, the
goalkeeper dives or jumps up to save the
goal. By his action the goalkeeper tries
to apply a force on the moving ball. The
force applied by him can stop or deflect
the ball, saving a goal being scored. If
the goalkeeper succeeds in stopping the
ball, its speed decreases to zero.
These observations suggest that a
force applied on an object may change
its speed. If the force applied on the object
is in the direction of its motion, the speed
of the object increases. If the force is
applied in the direction opposite to the
direction of motion, then it results in a
decrease in the speed of the object.

Let us consider some more
examples. In a game of volleyball,
players often push the moving ball to
their team mates to make a winning
move. Sometimes the ball is returned
to the other side of the court by
pushing or smashing it. In cricket, a
batsman plays his or her shot by
applying a force on the ball with the
bat. Is there any change in the
direction of motion of the ball in these
cases? In all these examples the speed
and the direction of the moving ball
change due to the application of a
force. Can you give a few more
examples of this kind?
A change in either the speed of an
object, or its direction of motion, or both,
is described as a change in its state of
motion. Thus, a force may bring a
change in the state of motion of an
object.
Fig. 8.8 : (a) A ball set in motion by
pushing it along a level surface
and (b) the direction of motion
of the ball after it strikes the
ruler placed in its path
(a)
State of Motion
The state of motion of an object is
described by its speed and the
direction of motion. The state of rest
is considered to be the state of zero
speed. An object may be at rest or in
motion; both are its states of motion.
Paheli is curious to know whether
application of a force can only change the
speed of an object. Let us find out.
Activity 8.4
Take a ball and place it on a level
surface as you did in Activity 8.3.
Make the ball move by giving it a
push [Fig. 8.8(a)]. Now place a ruler
in its path as shown in Fig. 8.8(b).
In doing so, you would apply a force
on the moving ball. Does the ball
continue to move in the same
direction after it strikes the ruler?
Repeat the activity and try to
obstruct the moving ball by placing
the ruler in such a way that it
makes different angles to its path.
In each case note your observations
about the direction of motion of the
ball after it strikes the ruler.
(b)
Does it mean that the application of
a force would always result in a change
in the state of motion of the object? Let
us find out.
It is common experience that many
a time application of force does not result
in a change in the state of motion. For
example, a heavy box may not move at
all even if you apply the maximum force
that you can exert. Again, no effect of
force is observed when you try to push
a wall.",Educational Materials,
"What do you conclude from the
observations noted in Table 8.2? What
happens when you apply a force on
an inflated balloon by pressing it
between your palms? What happens
to the shape of a ball of dough when it
is rolled to make a chapati? What
happens when you press a rubber ball
placed on a table? In all these
examples you saw that the application
of force on an object may change
its shape.
Having performed all the above
activities, you would have realised that
a force
l may make an object move from rest.
l may change the speed of an object
if it is moving.
l may change the direction of motion
of an object.
l may bring about a change in the
shape of an object.
l may cause some or all of these
effects.
While a force may cause one or more
of these effects, it is important to
remember that none of these actions can
take place without the action of a force.
Thus, an object cannot move by itself,
it cannot change speed by itself, it
cannot change direction by itself and
its shape cannot change by itself.

your body has to be in contact with the
object. The contact may also be with the
help of a stick or a piece of rope. When
we push an object like a school bag or
lift a bucket of water, where does the
force come from? This force is caused
by the action of muscles in our body.
The force resulting due to the action of
muscles is known as the muscular
force.
It is the muscular force that enables
us to perform all activities involving
movement or bending of our body. In
Class VII you have learnt that in the
process of digestion the food gets
pushed through the alimentary canal.
Could it be a muscular force that does
it? You also know that lungs expand
and contract while we inhale and
exhale air during breathing. Where
are these muscles located which
make breathing possible? Can you list
a few more examples of the force
exerted by the muscles in our body?
Animals also make use of muscular
force to carry out their physical activities
and other tasks. Animals like bullocks,
horses, donkeys and camels are used to
perform various tasks for us. In
per forming these tasks they use
muscular force (Fig. 8.9).

FORCE AND PRESSURE 101
Since muscular force can be applied
only when it is in contact with an object,
it is also called a contact force. Are there
other types of contact forces? Let us find
out.
Friction
Recall some of your experiences. A ball
rolling along the ground gradually slows
down and finally comes to rest. When
we stop pedalling a bicycle, it gradually
slows down and finally comes to a stop.
A car or a scooter also comes to rest
once its engine is switched off. Similarly,
a boat comes to rest if we stop rowing
it. Can you add some more such
experiences?
In all these situations no force
appears to be acting on the objects, yet
their speed gradually decreases and
they come to rest after some time. What
causes a change in their state of motion?
Could some force be acting on them!
Can you guess the direction in which
the force must be acting in each case?
The force responsible for changing the
state of motion of objects in all these
examples is the force of friction. It is the
force of friction between the surface of
the ball and the ground that brings the
moving ball to rest. Similarly, friction
between water and the boat brings it to
a stop once you stop rowing.
The force of friction always acts on
all the moving objects and its direction
is always opposite to the direction of
motion. Since the force of friction arises
due to contact between surfaces, it is
also an example of a contact force. You
will learn more about this force in
Chapter 9.
You may be wondering whether it is
essential for the agent applying a force
on an object to be always in contact with
it. Let us find out.
8.7 Non-contact Forces
Magnetic Force
Activity 8.6
Take a pair of bar magnets. Place
the longer side of one of the magnets
over three round shaped pencils or
wooden rollers as shown in
Fig. 8.10. Now bring one end of the
other magnet near the end of the
magnet placed on the rollers. Make
sure that the two magnets do not
touch each other. Observe what
happens. Next, bring the other end
of the magnet near the same end
of the magnet placed on the rollers
(Fig.8.10). Note what happens to
the magnet placed on the rollers
every time another magnet is
brought near it.

Fig. 8.11 : A straw rubbed with paper attracts
another straw but repels it if it has
also been rubbed with a sheet
of paper
A straw is said to have acquired
electrostatic charge after it has been
rubbed with a sheet of paper. Such a
straw is an example of a charged body.
The force exerted by a charged body
on another charged or uncharged body
is known as electrostatic force. This
force comes into play even when the
bodies are not in contact. The
electrostatic force, therefore, is another
example of a non-contact force. You will
learn more about electric charges in
Chapter 12.
Gravitational Force
You know that a coin or a pen falls to the
ground when it slips off your hand.
Leaves and fruits also fall to the ground
when they get detached from the plant.
Have you ever wondered why it is so?
When the coin is held in your hand it
is at rest. As soon as it is released, it
begins to move downwards. It is clear that
the state of motion of the coin undergoes
a change. Can this happen without a
force acting on it? Which is this force?
Does the magnet on the rollers begin
to move when the other magnet is brought
near it? Does it always move in the
direction of the approaching magnet?
What do these observations suggest? Does
it mean that some force must be acting
between the two magnets?
You have learnt in Class VI that like
poles of two magnets repel each other and
unlike poles attract each other. Attraction
or repulsion between objects can also be
seen as another form of pull or push. Do
you have to bring the magnets in contact
for observing the force between them? A
magnet can exert a force on another
magnet without being in contact with it.
The force exerted by a magnet is an
example of a non-contact force.
Similarly, the force exerted by a
magnet on a piece of iron is also a
non-contact force.
Electrostatic Force
Activity 8.7
Take a plastic straw and cut it into
nearly two equal pieces. Suspend one
of the pieces from the edge of a table
with the help of a piece of thread
(Fig. 8.11). Now hold the other piece
of straw in your hand and rub its
free end with a sheet of paper. Bring
the rubbed end of the straw near the
suspended straw. Make sure that the
two pieces do not touch each other.
What do you observe?
Next, rub the free end of the
suspended piece of straw with a
sheet of paper. Again, bring the
piece of straw that was rubbed
earlier with paper near the free end
of the suspended straw. What do you
observe now?

FORCE AND PRESSURE 103
Objects or things fall towards the
earth because it pulls them. This force
is called the force of gravity, or just
gravity. This is an attractive force. The
force of gravity acts on all objects. The
force of gravity acts on all of us all the
time without our being aware of it. Water
begins to flow towards the ground as
soon as we open a tap. Water in rivers
flows downward due to the force
of gravity.
Try cutting vegetables with a blunt
knife and then with a sharp knife. Which
is easier?
Do you get the feeling that the area
over which the force is applied (for
example, the pointed end of the nail)
plays a role in making these tasks easier?
The force acting on a unit area of a
surface is called pressure.
pressure = force / area on which it acts
At this stage we consider only those
forces which act perpendicular to the
surface on which the pressure is to
be computed.
Gravity is not a property of the earth
alone. In fact, every object in the
universe, whether small or large,
exerts a force on every other object.
This force is known as the
gravitational force.
8.8 Pressure
Is there any relation between pressure
and force? Let us find out.
Try to push a nail into a wooden
plank by its head. Did you succeed? Try
now to push the nail by the pointed end
(Fig. 8.12). Could you do it this time?
I now understand why
porters place a round piece
of cloth on their heads,
when they have to carry
heavy loads (Fig. 8.13). By
doing this they increase the
area of contact of the load
with their head. So, the
pressure on their head is
reduced and they find it
easier to carry the load.

Note that the area is in the
denominator in the above expression.
So, the smaller the area, larger the
pressure on a surface for the same force.
The area of the pointed end of the nail
is much smaller than that of its head.
The same force, therefore, produces a
pressure sufficient to push the pointed
end of the nail into the wooden plank.
Can you explain now why shoulder
bags are provided with broad straps and
not thin strap? And, why the tools
meant for cutting and piercing always
have sharp edges?
Do liquids and gases also exert
pressure? Does it also depend on the
area on which the force acts? Let us
find out.

Activity 8.8
Take a transparent glass tube or a
plastic pipe. The length of the pipe/
tube should be about 25 cm and its
diameter should be 5-7.5 cm. Also
take a piece of thin sheet of a good
quality rubber, say, a rubber
balloon. Stretch the rubber sheet
tightly over one end of the pipe.
Hold the pipe at the middle, keeping
it in a vertical position (Fig. 8.14).
Ask one of your friends to pour some
water in the pipe. Does the rubber
sheet bulge out? Note also the
height of the water column in the
pipe. Pour some more water.
Observe again the bulge in the
rubber sheet and the height of the
water column in the pipe. Repeat
this process a few more times. Can
you see any relation between the
amount of the bulge in the rubber
sheet and the height of the water
column in the pipe?

inserting it near the bottom of the
bottle. Make sure that the water
does not leak from the joint. If there
is any leakage, seal it with molten

as well? Let us investigate further.

Take an empty plastic bottle or a

I have seen fountains of water
coming out of the leaking joints

say that air exerts pressure in all
directions?
Do you recall what happens to the
air in the bicycle tube when it has a
puncture? Do these observations suggest
that air exerts pressure on the inner walls
of an inflated balloon or a tube? So, we
find that gases, too, exert pressure on
the walls of their container.
8.10 Atmospheric Pressure
You know that there is air all around
us. This envelop of air is known as the
atmosphere. The atmospheric air
extends up to many kilometres above
the surface of the earth. The pressure
exerted by this air is known as
atmospheric pressure. We know that
pressure is force per unit area. If we
imagine a unit area and a very long
cylinder standing on it filled with air,
then the force of gravity on the air in
this cylinder is the atmospheric
pressure (Fig. 8.17).
Fig. 8.18 : A rubber sucker pressed on a
surface
When you press the sucker, most of
the air between its cup and the surface
escapes out. The sucker sticks to the
sur face because the pressure of
atmosphere acts on it. To pull the sucker
off the surface, the applied force should
be large enough to overcome the
atmospheric pressure. This activity
might give you an idea about the
magnitude of atmospheric pressure. In
fact, it would not be possible for any
human being to pull the sucker off the
But, how large or small is the
atmospheric pressure? Let us get an
idea about its magnitude.

The force due to air in a column of
the height of the atmosphere and area
15 cm  15 cm (Fig. 8.19) is nearly equal
to the force of gravity on an object of
mass 225 kg (2250N). The reason we
are not crushed under this force of
gravity is that the pressure inside our
bodies is also equal to the atmospheric
pressure and balances the pressure from
outside.",Educational Materials,

1. Make a 50 cm  50 cm bed of dry sand about 10 cm in thickness.
Make sure that its top surface is levelled. Take a wooden or a plastic
stool. Cut two strips of graph paper each with a width of 1 cm.
Paste them vertically on any leg of the stool - one at the bottom and
the other from the top. Now gently put the stool on the sand bed
with its legs resting on the sand. Increase the size of sand bed if
required. Now put a load, say a school bag full of books, on the seat
of the stool. Mark the level of sand on the graph strip. This would
give you the depth, if any, to which the legs of stool sink in sand.
Next, turn the stool upside down so that now it rests on its seat on
the sand bed. Note the depth to which the stool sinks now. Next,
put the same load on the stool and note the depth to which it sinks
in the sand. Compare the pressure exerted by the stool in the two
situations.
2. Take a tumbler and fill it with water. Cover the mouth of the tumbler
