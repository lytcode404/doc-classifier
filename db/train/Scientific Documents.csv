"The zebra finch (Poephila guttata) is a sexually dimorphic, social estrildid native to the grasslands of Australia. They are opportunistic, year-round breeders which nest in colonies of variable size. Zebra finches form permanent pair bonds and both sexes share the responsibilities of nest building, incubation and rearing of young (Walter, 1973). Morris (1954), however, reported that although both sexes pick up and nibble on fragments of material, males collect most of the nesting material.",Scientific Research Paper
"The purpose of this study was to test whether or not this preference for certain colors of leg bands generalizes to preference for certain colors of nesting material. It was hypothesized that zebra finches would collect more red or black material than light green, with collection of orange being intermediate.",Scientific Research Paper
"Studies on the effects of colored plastic leg bands on pair formation show that male zebra finches spend more time sitting next to females wearing black or pink leg bands than females wearing light blue leg bands. The same studies indicate that females spend more time sitting next to males wearing red leg bands than males wearing light green bands. In both male and female, orange leg bands (which are similar to natural leg color) proved to be of intermediate preference (Burley, 1981 and 1982).",Scientific Research Paper
"he zebra finches used in this study were in three colonies in the lab of Dr. J.R. Baylis at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Each colony contained between thirty and forty individual birds of both sexes, a variety of ages and several plumage types. All animals wore colored leg bands for individual identification and all had been exposed to grass, green embroidery floss and white dog fur as nesting material previous to this study. The colonies were housed in separate rooms, each approximately 17m3 and each contained eight artificial nest boxes. All behavioral observations were made from outside the colony rooms through one-way mirrors.",Scientific Research Paper
"RESULTS More green material was removed by the finches than red, more red than black and more black than orange. The ratio between material of different colors used in nest construction differed significantly from the expected 1:1:1:1 (X2=63.44, df=3, p<.005). When colors were compared in pairs, the difference between values for green and red were not significantly different (X2=117, df=1, p>.5). However, the values for black and orange were significantly different (X2=36.38, df=1, p<.005).",Scientific Research Paper
"The results from these experiments suggest that zebra finches do in fact have color preferences with regard to nesting material. Contrary to the predictions made by generalizing Burley’s studies (1981, 1982), however, the zebra finches used in this study preferred green, red or black nesting material to orange. These results are similar to those of Collias and Collias (1981) who showed that weaver birds preferred green nesting material.",Scientific Research Paper
"Alternative hypotheses are also provided, and evidence from literature is given in support of the alternate hypothesis. Future studies are proposed to help further knowledge in the area.",Scientific Research Paper
"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019 and its subsequent global spread has led to millions of infections and substantial morbidity and mortality (1). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the clinical disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, can range from mild, self-limiting disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death (2). The mechanisms underlying the spectrum of COVID-19 disease severity states and the nature of protective immunity against COVID-19 remain unclear.",Scientific Research Paper
"Studies investigating the human immune response against SARS-CoV-2 have begun to characterize SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific T cell responses (3–8), and multiple studies have described marked activation of T cell subsets in acute COVID-19 patients (9–13). Unexpectedly, antigen-specific T cell studies performed with five different cohorts reported that 20 to 50% of people who had not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 had significant T cell reactivity directed against peptides corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 sequences (3–7). The studies were from geographically diverse cohorts (the United States, the Netherlands, Germany, Singapore, and the United Kingdom), and the general pattern observed was that the T cell reactivity found in unexposed individuals was predominantly mediated by CD4+ T cells. It was speculated that this phenomenon might be due to preexisting memory responses against human “common cold” coronaviruses (HCoVs) such as HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E. These HCoVs share partial sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2, are widely circulating in the general population, and are typically responsible for mild respiratory symptoms (14–16). However, the hypothesis of cross-reactive immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and common cold HCoVs still awaits experimental trials. This potential preexisting cross-reactive T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has broad implications because it could explain aspects of differential COVID-19 clinical outcomes, influence epidemiological models of herd immunity (17, 18), or affect the performance of COVID-19 candidate vaccines.",Scientific Research Paper

"ells are the building blocks of all living things. Each type of cell plays a different role in
the human body. A stem cell is a special type of cell; specific types of body cells (such as
skin cells, intestine cells, or red blood cells) are formed from stem cells.
Some stem cells are able to develop into every kind of body cell. Other stem cells are
more limited and can become several different kinds of cells, but not every kind of body
cell. For example, stem cells in bone marrow (found inside your bones) can become red
blood cells and white blood cells and all of the other parts of blood. However, these stem
cells cannot become skin cells.
What is a stem cell line?
Stem cells grown in a lab are called stem cell “lines.” A cell line is a group of cells that
come from a single tissue sample (e.g., a blood sample or tissue taken from a muscle,
which is called a “biopsy”). Each cell in a cell line will have the same genes as the tissue
sample that it came from.
All stem cell lines:
> Can divide to make copies of themselves; for this reason, a stem cell line growing in a
lab could exist for a very long time, even longer than your lifetime
> Can become some other types of body cells
> Contain the same genetic information as the person who gave the sample",Scientific Research Paper
"Why are researchers interested in stem cells?
Studying stem cells can help scientists understand more about how the body works
and how disease develops and affects the body. Working with stem cells may help
researchers better understand different diseases and conditions, and find new treat-
ments. Scientists hope one day to be able to use stem cells to help replace tissues in
the body that were damaged by disease or injury.
Benefits and risks of participating in stem cell research?
By participating in stem cell research, there’s no direct benefit for you, but taking part
may help others in the future.
The risks involved in providing a tissue sample will depend on the type of sample you
are providing (e.g., blood draw, skin biopsy, cheek swab, bone marrow biopsy, etc.).
The research team will describe the procedure and risks during the informed consent
process. A stem cell line made from your tissue contains your genetic information and
may be linked to your identity. There is a risk this information could accidentally be
shared with others. The researchers will explain how they guard against this.
Participating in research is a choice
Agreeing to take part in research is a process. The research team will discuss the
research with you. They will explain the study’s goals and possible risks and benefits.
The research team will review an Informed Consent Form with you. All study proce-
dures, risks, and any possible benefits will be described in detail in this form.

"Abstract
Finding a Hadamard matrix (H-matrix) among all possible binary matrices of corresponding order is a hard problem that can be solved by a quantum computer. Due to the limitation on the number of qubits and connections in current quantum processors, only low order H-matrix search of orders 2 and 4 were implementable by previous method. In this paper, we show that by adopting classical searching techniques of the H-matrices, we can formulate new quantum computing methods for finding higher order ones. We present some results of finding H-matrices of order up to more than one hundred and a prototypical experiment of the classical-quantum resource balancing method that yields a 92-order H-matrix previously found by Jet Propulsion Laboratory researchers in 1961 using a mainframe computer. Since the exactness of the solutions can be verified by an orthogonality test performed in polynomial time; which is untypical for optimization of hard problems, the proposed method can potentially be used for demonstrating practical quantum supremacy in the near future.

Introduction
Background
A Hadamard matrix (H-matrix) is a binary orthogonal matrix with 
 elements whose any distinct pair of its columns (or rows) are orthogonal to each other. Such a matrix only exists when it is square and the length of its column (row) is equal to 1, 2 or a multiple of four; i.e., for an 
 dimension H-matrix, then 
 or 
 for a positive integer k. The reversed statement that for any positive integer k there is a H-matrix is also believed to be true, although neither a mathematical proof nor disproof yet exists. This is a long standing problem of the Hadamard Matrix Conjecture.

The H-matrix has been a subject of scientific and practical interests. First discovered and described by Sylverster in 18671, it is further studied by Hadamard concerning its relationship with the determinant problem2. The orthogonal property and binaryness of its elements make it widely used in information processing and digital communications. The CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) system employs Hadamard-Walsh code to reduce interference among their users, so that the capacity of the communication system is not badly deteriorated by the increasing number of its users3,4. The H-matrix was also used by Mariner 9 space-craft as its ECC (Error Correcting Code) for sending images of Mars to a receiving station located on Earth, thanks to its capability for long error correction4,5.

"Introduction
A popular method for training artificial neural networks is related to synaptic plasticity (SP), which governs the brain adaptation mechanism1 and where the connection strength between two neurons is modified following their relative activities2,3. This local adaptation is the foundation of the learning process of artificial neural networks (ANNs)4. Classification and representation of practical problems require feedforward networks comprising hidden layers to be trained5, which mediate between input and output units6 (Fig. 1a). This is how deep learning (DL), as a subfield of machine learning, originated, which now outperforms humans in addressing difficult problems7,8, such as face recognition, and games (e.g., chess and go)",Scientific Research Paper
"Results
Long-lasting assumption of SP
The current version of imprinted SP is based on mutual, time-dependent activity by pre- and post- synaptic neurons3 (Fig. 1b). This is supported by experimental evidence showing adaptation typically consumes tens of minutes and incorporates considerable fluctuations14. Its main mechanism is the BP signal along the dendrite, which serves as a byproduct of the spiking neuron to its axon 14,15,16 (Fig. 1b). The long transportation distance from the soma to the synapse, along varying conducting dendritic brunches, is expected to be noisy and to fluctuate. The main complexity of the SP assumption is that synapses and dendrites are connected in series (Fig. 1c). However, existing experiments that stimulate two presynaptic neurons, or pre- and post-synaptic neurons, cannot pinpoint the significant imprinted adaptation location, whether it is located at the synapse or at the dendrite. Although there is a consensus on temporal adaptation in synaptic boutons and spines, following their recent stimulation patterns, their time independent imprinted adaptation without further stimulations is in question. In addition, assuming imprinted SP, one cannot exclude from current experiments fast and significant enhanced adaptation in the dendrites connected in series to the synapses.",Scientific Research Paper

"Experimental methods
The In-Vitro experimental methods are similar to those of our previous studies43,45, and only the modifications are presented.

Animal use
All procedures were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Bar-Ilan University Guidelines for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals in Research and were approved and supervised by the Bar-Ilan University Animal Care and Use Committee.

Stimulations—MEA
Extracellular stimulations were applied with an amplitude of [− 900 − 200] mV and a duration of [0.2 2] ms.

Neuronal response latency
The neuronal response latency is defined as the time-lag between a stimulation pulse onset and its corresponding evoked spike measured by crossing a threshold of − 20 mV.

Statistical analysis
Reported results are based on 8 experiments, using different examined neuronal cultures. Presented results demonstrate an example of a decrease of 100 mV in the stimulation threshold amplitude after training. This decrease was observed in all 8 experiments. We detected stable neurons with appropriate features of stimulating electrodes (e.g. same spike waveforms with different maximal firing frequencies and neuronal responses latencies) in 8 out of 15 examined cultures.",Scientific Research Paper
