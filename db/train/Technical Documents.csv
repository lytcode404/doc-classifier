"Best practices
After you set up and register the computer, we recommend the following steps to get the most out of
your smart investment:
● Back up your hard drive by creating recovery media. See Backing up, restoring, and recovering on
page 57.
● If you haven’t already done so, connect to a wired or wireless network. See details in Connecting to a
network on page 17.
● Become familiar with the computer hardware and software. For more information, see Getting to
know your computer on page 3 and Enjoying entertainment features on page 21.
● Update or purchase antivirus software. See Using antivirus software on page 45.
● Access HP Support Assistant app—For quick online support, open the HP Support Assistant
app (select products only). HP Support Assistant optimizes computer performance and resolves
problems using the latest software updates, diagnostic tools, and guided assistance. Select the
Search icon in the taskbar, type support in the search box, and then select HP Support Assistant.

"3 Connecting to a network
Your computer can travel with you wherever you go. But even at home, you can explore the globe and
access information from millions of websites by using your computer and a wired or wireless network
connection. This chapter helps you get connected to that world.
Connecting to a wireless network
Your computer might be equipped with one or more wireless devices.
● WLAN device—Connects the computer to wireless local area networks (commonly referred to as
Wi-Fi networks, wireless LANs, or WLANs) in corporate offices, your home, and public places such
as airports, restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, and universities. The WLAN device in your computer
communicates with a wireless router or a wireless access point.
● HP Mobile Broadband Module—Gives you wireless connectivity over a wireless wide area network
(WWAN), a much larger area. Mobile network operators install base stations (similar to cell phone
towers) throughout large geographic areas, effectively providing coverage across entire states,
regions, or even countries.
● Bluetooth® device—Creates a personal area network (PAN) to connect to other Bluetooth-enabled
devices such as computers, phones, printers, headsets, speakers, and cameras. In a PAN, each
device communicates directly with other devices, and devices must be relatively close together—
typically within 10 m (approximately 33 ft) of each other.
Using the wireless controls
You can control the wireless devices in your computer using one or more features.
● Airplane mode key (also called wireless button or wireless key)
● Operating system controls
Airplane mode key
The computer might have an airplane mode key, one or more wireless devices, and one or two wireless
lights. All the wireless devices on your computer are enabled at the factory.
The wireless light indicates the overall power state of your wireless devices, not the status of individual
devices.
Operating system controls
The Network and Sharing Center allows you to set up a connection or network, connect to a network,
and diagnose and repair network problems.
To use operating system controls:
On the taskbar, right-click the network status icon, and then select Network and Internet settings.
Connecting to a WLAN
Before you can connect to a WLAN with this procedure, you must first set up internet access.",Technical Manuals
"Standards and legislation
Countries worldwide are enacting regulations to improve access to products and services for persons
with disabilities. These regulations are historically applicable to telecommunications products and
services, PCs and printers with certain communications and video playback features, their associated
user documentation, and their customer support.
Standards
The US Access Board created Section 508 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) standards to
address access to information and communication technology (ICT) for people with physical, sensory, or
cognitive disabilities.
The standards contain technical criteria specific to various types of technologies, as well as
performance-based requirements which focus on functional capabilities of covered products. Specific
criteria cover software applications and operating systems, web-based information and applications,
computers, telecommunications products, video and multimedia, and self-contained closed products.
Mandate 376 – EN 301 549
The European Union created the EN 301 549 standard within Mandate 376 as an online toolkit for public
procurement of ICT products. The standard specifies the accessibility requirements applicable to ICT
products and services, with a description of the test procedures and evaluation methodology for each
requirement.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) from the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) helps
web designers and developers create sites that better meet the needs of people with disabilities or
age-related limitations.
WCAG advances accessibility across the full range of web content (text, images, audio, and video)
and web applications. WCAG can be precisely tested, is easy to understand and use, and allows web
developers flexibility for innovation. WCAG 2.0 has also been approved as ISO/IEC 40500:2012.
WCAG specifically addresses barriers to accessing the web experienced by people with visual, auditory,
physical, cognitive, and neurological disabilities, and by older web users with accessibility needs. WCAG
2.0 provides characteristics of accessible content:
● Perceivable (for instance, by addressing text alternatives for images, captions for audio, adaptability
of presentation, and color contrast)
● Operable (by addressing keyboard access, color contrast, timing of input, seizure avoidance, and
navigability)
● Understandable (by addressing readability, predictability, and input assistance)
● Robust (for instance, by addressing compatibility with assistive technologies)",Technical Manuals

"1 Introduction Maintaining an accurate log book can be a tedious affair. The GPS Log Book is a simple device that, together with an online system, greatly simplifies and assists this process. The benefits of the additional tax savings make it a very worthwhile device to own. Keeping an accurate log book of business and personal travel is not only required as a legal prerequisite by the South African Revenue Service (SARS) if travel expenses are to be claimed, it also allows claims to be based on the actual distances travelled. Without a Log book it would not be possible to claim for travel deductions. 1.1 Who can benefit from keeping an accurate Log Book  Sole proprietors, commission earners  Employees who receive a travel allowance  Employees, directors, members who use a company owned vehicle 1.2 Key Features of GPS Log Book  User friendly and well-designed online system  SARS Compliance  Google Maps used to display trips  Customisation of start and end points (zones) specific to any trip  One year warranty period from date of purchase  Easy to add new vehicles  Easy to use on different computers  Ample storage capacity  Frequent recording interval on the device  No annual or monthly subscription fees are associated with the GPS Log Book and related services",Technical Manuals
